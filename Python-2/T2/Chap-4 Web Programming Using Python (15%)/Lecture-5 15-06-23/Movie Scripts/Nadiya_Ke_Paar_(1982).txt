We get so tired filling water.
My uncle was telling my aunt
that this time after the harvest..
..we will install a tube well.
Then we will not
face any water problem.
When you will install a tube well..
..then you can fill
water whenever you like.
Pull the bucket now.
Even we want to fill water.
Then fill it!
Here, now you fill water!
Why are you getting angry on us?
Did we drop your bucket in the well?
You let it down yourself!






Hey, now where are you going?
I am going to call Chandan to
get the bucket out of the well.
Good.. Rajjo got an
opportunity to meet Chandan.
Chandan! Chandan!
Chandan! Hey you, Chandan!
What is it?
Is this how you sleep?
Since so long I am
calling out to you.
You can't even hear!
I heard! How did I know that
you were calling out to me?
I thought that I was dreaming.
That someone is calling me in dream.
You cannot see me
standing in front of you..
..and you can hear me
call out in your dream?
Hey! Get up! Will
you again go to sleep?






Come on! Come with me. Come on!
My bucket has fallen in the well.
Take a hook along with
you and take it out.
Early morning you
have come to trouble me.
Take a hook along!
Why are you looking at my face now?
- Let's go.
Her bucket only has
to fall in the well..
Brother, I will be
back removing her bucket.
Okay, go.
What happened, Tiwari? Why have
you covered yourself with a shawl?
You are feeling fine I hope?
No, aunt, my health has gone
down a little! - Is that so?
Uncle!
- What are you doing here?
Nothing, uncle! My bucket
has fallen in the water.
That is why I had come
here to call Chandan.
Whenever something
like this happens..
..then this poor girl
comes to call Chandan.
Go and remove her bucket.
Brother, just..
- Yes! Yes! Uncle come, we will go.
Chandan, be careful!
- I am careful!
I will not jump into the
well and kill myself..
..just for the sake of your bucket.
Chandu, whom for will
you risk your life then?
Sister-in-law, I would
have given up my life for you.
What do I do but? You have already
taken brother Aniruddh's life.
Yes! I got it!
Here! Here take your bucket!
- Yes!
The rope was not broken but
the noose had loosened up.
You can't even tie
the noose properly!
Return the hook to my home.
Chandan!
- Yes, brother!
Come and have your food.
Yes! Uncle, come on, get up.
No, child, I will
not eat anything now.
Let's see if I benefit.
What? You have not eaten
anything since morning.
Will you be able to bear the hunger?
Dear, I will have
to bear it somehow.
You go.. go.. - Okay, as you wish..
How are you, Tiwari?
How are you feeling now?
Aunt!
- Has your fever subsided or not?
The fever has not subsided..
..but the pain in my
stomach is a little bearable now.
What? What do you mean by
stomach pain is bearable?
Means..
- Granny, what will he tell you?
He's is just lying
like this since morning.
He is trying his own
methods of medicine.
There is no improvement at all.
I will just observe tonight.
Otherwise, tomorrow morning,
I will call the doctor..
..from Chaubepur and get
him checked up. - Yes!
Yes! Yes! Give all the
money to those doctors.
Wait for a few days. Have patience.
What to see? We have
to bear the trouble.
Now the days have
arrived for sowing and plowing.
We might get some help from you,
those hopes too are gone.
On top of that, shall I look
after the house all alone..
..cook food, shall I nurse
you or work in the fields?
Tell me, granny, am I lying?
No, dear, you are absolutely right.
My dear good man, you
are troubling yourself..
..so that you do not
have to spend money.
You are troubling the children too.
Omkar, it's my advice that
you call the doctor tomorrow.
Okay? Understood?
The Deepashakti fair is approaching.
Will you come with me?
- Hey Chandan, this is Chaubepur.
Okay, is this it?
- I have saved a lot of money.
Even I have saved a lot
of money in my piggy bank.
In the fair we will sit
on the giant wheel and..
And Jalebi..
Hey you! Are you blind?
Why do you say that?
Then? What is the meaning of
bringing the boat on us like this?
Have I purposely
crashed the boat on to you?
No! You are very innocent,
isn't it?
What can I do? The
place is slippery.
I could not properly
oar it.. it just slipped!
You could not
handle one small boat..
..then what made you row it?
You wanted to bring
your boat here only?
You could not find
any other river bank?
How am I supposed to
know which bank is where?
You are unnecessarily making a
big issue of out of nothing!
Your talking..
If you have not ever seen
a fool then see one now.
You won't see like this. If
ever I get an opportunity..
..I will show you whether I
am a fool or something else.
Who has the time
here to see all this?
Hey! Now why are you
glaring like this! Go your way.
Yes.. I am going!
Where does the doctor stay?
Doctor?
- Which doctor?
Now just see this! You
stay in Chaubepur and..
..you do not know
where the doctor stays?
If you know then go
and search for yourself.
Hey Gunja, tell them.
If you know please tell us,
we have some work.
Okay, look here, go
straight in the village.
Further you will
come to cross roads.
Take to left from
there and then go straight.
In a corner you will
find a peepul tree.
There you will find
the doctor's house.
Yes! Thank you! Come!
- Come!
Gunja.
- Keep quiet!
Just help me! - Let it be! Why
do you want to unnecessarily..
Why unnecessarily? He
was acting very smart.
First you see how smart Gunja is!
Come on quickly help me. Come on.
See this! We wandered
the entire village..
..and now we are standing on
the outskirts of the village.
We did not see any peepul tree!
Is it that we took the wrong path?
Brother, we came the
way she asked us to.
It is a different thing if
she guided us the wrong way.
I think we should ask someone.
Whom shall we ask?
This village is very strange,
brother! - The village is strange?
It is indeed very strange!
I don't understand..
Hey boy.. hey listen..
hey, that boy went away!
Come we will go in and ask!
- Come!
Where does the doctor stay?
- Which doctor?
This is Chaubepur village,
isn't it? - Yes!
A doctor stays over here..
where is his house?
I don't know!
Hey brother! You have
barged into the house..
..and you are
asking for the address?
Come on! Go out!
Yes! Yes! Brother, we are going!
Please, tell us where
does the doctor stay?
If you know.
- Why won't I know? Come out!
Yes, I am the doctor! Tell me!
We have come to take you.
From where?
- From Balihar!
From Balihar? - Yes! We have
brought even the boat along.
Please, make it fast. - You will
have to wait for a while!
You sit here. I will
get ready and come.
Okay! Come!
Oh! Hey! Hey! This is the
same girl we met at the river!
What happened?
Nothing, mother!
How did these vessels fall down?
She walks looking somewhere else.
If Rupa would not have taken care
the milk too would have got spilt.
Gunja's traits are such!!
Where was your attention?
Have you played any
mischief somewhere?
No, sister! That.. that boat!
- Boat?
Where is your boat?
Hey! Where has the boat
disappeared?
We had left it right here!
See there! It has
gone and stuck up there!
It's good that it got
stuck up there otherwise..
..it would sailed far
away somewhere. Yes.
The girls from Chaubepur,
they are really troublesome.
The girls from Chaubepur? Why?
What else? Has the
boat sailed by it self?
It was pushed away! See there!
When we came here, they
all were washing vessels.
They must have pushed it away!
One of them was your daughter.
You can go and ask her!
What is there to ask?
This is so obvious.
I will go and get the boat.
- Yes, brother.
Mr. Tiwari, your disease
is very old in my opinion.
You did not take care
from the beginning..
..that is why it has become worse.
It will take some time for
you to recover completely.
What type of royal
illness am I suffering from?
It is not any royal
illness but it is an illness.
A person should take care of his
diet as he starts getting older.
What relief will I get with that?
They say that..
Profit and loss, birth and death,
success and failure..
..all that is destiny.
If my end is destined
then I will definitely die.
Till today I have
never taken any medicines.
I can't say anything in
front of these children.
They got carried away by the
villagers and called you here.
Give the money for
the medicine now. Give!
Why do you worry about the money?
We will do only that
which makes you feel happy.
But do as I advise you to.
Take medicines regularly
and take care of your diet.
What diet!
This red packet, give him
morning and night with honey.
The yellow packet.. four
times a day with water.
This medicine is for three days.
- Okay!
Doctor..
..you said that it will take some
time for him to get cured completely?
My dear, after taking this
medicine for three days..
..we will see whether
there is any effect or not..
..and then I will continue the
medicine accordingly. - Okay!
Come after three days and
let me know his condition.
Okay! Goodbye, Mr.
Tiwari! - Goodbye, doctor!
Greetings!
Gunja!
- Yes, father!
You pushed away the boat
of Chandan who had come..
..to take me along in the morning?
Did he tell you that?
- Yes!
Okay! He did not tell
you what he did. - What?
He straight away pushed
the boat on my vessels.
If I would not have
got up, I could get hurt.
Is it?
- Yes!
Okay, the next time he comes,
do not fight with him.
Talk to him properly.
- Why should I even talk to him?
Do I keep fighting with everyone?
Oh my God!
Eat it!
It is still left! - Uncle!
Come, dear child. Come!
- Uncle, now how are you feeling?
I am fine! Sit! Where is Mishra?
Uncle has gone to the fields. I
have come here for aunt's work.
What is it?
Uncle, please send
Chandan along with me.
I want to pluck the
Indian gooseberries.
Are you going to make
a sweet pickle? - Yes!
Okay! I see! - Is it
Chandan that you always find?
Are there no servants in your house?
- They have all gone to the field.
Does she think that you are a
servant and comes to call you?
This poor girl comes
to meet you everyday.
He always talks bitterly with me.
He is a fool! Go! Go!
Uncle! I do not have any free time.
I have to go to
Chaubepur to get your medicines.
Are you going to take the
entire day to pluck the berries?
Go and pluck the berries and
from there go to Chaubepur.
Go! - Is it?
Go, take him!
- Okay!
Go pluck the berries.
- Come on!
Do not forget to give
me the sweet pickle!
Yes.. I won't!
Chandan! Hey Chandan! At least wait!
I cannot run like you!
Then you come slowly, I
will go ahead and pluck..
..many gooseberries for you.
Hey you, at least wait!
- What is it?
Oh my God! I am panting!
Sit for a while. I
will get my breath back!
Hey madam, I do not
have the time to sit.
I told you right in the beginning
that I have to go to Chaubepur.
Oh my God! The way you
keep repeating Chaubepur..
..as if your life is stuck there!
Sit down!
- Hey you! Come! Come on!
No! No! First listen to me.
Uncle has brought a
new book on dramas.
I have read a very
nice story from that.
I'd thought of
narrating you on the way.
So, you do one thing, you
come along with me to Chaubepur.
Is it?
We will bring uncle's
medicine from there..
..and we will get
you checked up as well.
What is wrong with me!
You have gone crazy, for
that we will treat you.
I have gone crazy?
- Then what?
Will you come quickly so
that I pluck the gooseberries?
I do not want any goose
berries to be plucked.
Hey Rajjo..
- I told you, you go to Chaubepur!
But you..
- You just go!
What happened? You got hurt?
Let me see! Let me see!
Forget this, first tell me,
do you want the berries..
..to be plucked or not?
- No!
Then do not go and
complain to my uncle.
I will not go and complain.
Okay listen! Give me
that book on drama.
I will read that, okay!
- I will not give you!
Very strange!
Doctor! Is the doctor at home?
Welcome.
Great! Today you are
greeting me so respectfully?
Are we supposed to beat the
one who comes at our door?
How can one guarantee
the girls from Chaubepur!
They can do anything.
- Are you so scared of them?
Hey no! Not fright!
What do they say the
clever are always alert.
Okay, so you have come alert?
I am born clever!
If someone pushes away
your boat behind your back.
..then what bravery is that!
No! In complaining you
show your bravery, isn't it?
All this later, first
tell me where is doctor?
He will come now,
you come and sit here.
Father!
- Yes, who is that?
Chandan. I have made him
sit in the physician's room.
You should have brought him inside.
Okay, let it be! Look here, I
am going, you get water for him.
Son, once you know the illness..
..then the medicines
will definitely work.
Father, water!
- Yes, give it to Chandan!
I am giving you
medicines for another seven days.
In between if I come to that
side then I will come to see him.
Continue giving him the
medicines in the same way..
..and yes take care of his diet.
- Okay!
Oh!
- What happened?
Is this water or acid?
Acid? How did you hurt your hand?
I hurt myself in the morning..
,,and now after this water
has spilt on it, it is burning.
Gunja, what kind of
water have you brought?
Father, the water is from the pot.
Then go.. and see maybe
something has fallen in the pot.
Get another glass of water.
Listen! The herbal paste that
you were grinding in the morning..
..get that in a bowl. Okay?
Apply a little, you will feel cool.
How did you hurt yourself? Did you
hurt yourself with some iron rod?
No.. I scraped against a bamboo.
Okay, then there
is nothing to worry.
Take this!
- Take it! Apply it my dear.
What type of paste this is?
This paste is very beneficial.
Apply it my dear.
I can smell coriander
and chilly in this. - What?
Oh! Looks like I brought chutney
instead of that herbal paste.
I will bring it just now.
- Let it be! Let it be!
You give me the medicines.
I am going!
Does she make the medicines?
- No! Why?
Otherwise some day she
will give some patient..
..poison instead of medicine.
Wait, I will go and
get the herbal paste.
Let it be! It's no big injury!
You give me the medicines!
- Okay!
Goodbye! - Goodbye!
Gunja! Gunja!
- Father, what is it?
Nothing, where is Gunja?
- What happened?
Please, explain to your daughter
that she should listen..
..to what is being told.
I had forbidden her but
she again played a mischief.
She will spoil the matter.
- What matter?
This boy has an
elder brother. Omkar!
I have liked him for Rupa!
Have you spoken to him?
I will speak when the time comes.
Let Mr. Tiwari get cured first.
You explain properly
to Gunja first.
Due to anger Thakur Pratap
Singh was fuming with rage.
His eyes..
- My dear Chandan!
Yes!
- Do a favor, my dear!
What's it?
Get me one chili
from the pickle jar.
Chili!
- Yes!
I cannot give you any chili!
Eat whatever is
there in front of you.
There is saw dust in front of me!
Is there any taste to this?
There is no chili or
spices or oil or even ghee.
Okay not one full but at
least get half a chili.
There will be a slight
change in the taste.
You finish eating, I will give
you something to change the taste..
Okay, what?
- Medicine!
Medicine! Medicine! Medicine!
The fever has subsided,
the pain has ebbed.
How long should I eat
this medicine?
Till the doctor does
not tell you to stop.
What will that doctor say!
He will tell me to
stop after my death.
He is interested in
gathering money.
He will keep giving medicines.
Uncle, what is the matter?
Oh my dear, Omkar! Please
free me from these medicines!
It is enough now!
Okay! You think this is too much?
Then we will stop it!
What am I going to lose!
You again fall sick and then
again start taking medicines!
Why will I fall
sick again and again?
You get irritated over small things!
Uncle, where do I get irritated?
I am talking about you.
Chandan, is the doctor
coming tomorrow? - No.
He has asked me to get the medicine.
Okay! We will do this. I
will go to the doctor's house.
I will tell him not
to give the medicine.
I will pay the money too and come.
What for you will go
there to give the money?
Whenever he happens to come here..
..we will sit across
and settle the accounts.
Are you going to
bargain with him, uncle?
I will not bargain with him.
Give him everything that you have!
Yes! I will give away.
Brother!
- Yes!
Just be careful of that doctor's
daughter when you go there.
Why?
- She is a fighter cock, brother!
Is the doctor at home?
- Yes, he is there!
From where have you come?
- From Balihar!
Tell him Omkar has
come from Balihar!
Ok.
Father, someone's come
from Balihar.
It must be Chandan! Call him in!
Go! Go and call him!
Listen. - Yes.
Father is performing veneration.
He has called you in.
You.. you are the
doctor's daughter?
Yes.
Hey Gunjiya, why
are you hiding here?
To give you an opportunity, so that
even you see that boy from Balihar.
As it is, mother and
father would not have shown you!
How do you know that he
has come from Balihar?
I had shown him the house!
Okay! So that is the case! Come on!
- Leave me!
No, dear, the medicine and
the diet both are necessary.
My dear child, the sick
people usually become like kids.
If you adhere to their wishes
then they cannot be treated.
You do one thing,
you take the medicine.
Next week when I come there,
I will check him up!
Okay! Oh yes! How much should
I pay you for the medicines?
You take that too from me..
Oh! Why are you
worried about the money?
When I will come there, I
will speak to your uncle.
Uncle! No! No! Uncle does
not understand any accounts.
I look after all that! Yes!
Okay, then I will talk to you only.
Leave it for today.
Here, have a little sherbet.
This is my younger daughter Gunja!
Is it! She is..
- Sherbet!
She is very mischievous.
Okay go, go and call your mother.
- Okay!
Mother, father is calling you!
Sister, did you like him?
Go away! - Tell me the truth!
He is nice, isn't he?
Won't you listen!
How are you?
- Very fine!
Uncle, water!
Hey dear. - What? - What
happened to that gooseberry pickle?
Sweet pickle? - Was it made?
Oh yes! Pickle!
- Pickle?
Mishra, you keep quiet!
You will not understand.
This is between us.
Take this my dear, God bless you!
Mishra, tell me more!
- What shall I tell you?
That drama group from Kanpur
had come here again. - Yes?
The entire program was for
four days! For four days!
You fell sick so we could not go!
- Oh my God!
Now that he is fine again, go!
Go and see the drama.
What nonsense are you..
What nonsense? Since
the time he has come..
..you are talking only
about that drama group.
Today morning you had promised me
that you would do a lot of work.
Everything will be done!
All will be done.
Nothing is going to be done.
The same thing has to
keep repeating many times!
Come brother Tiwari, we will go!
The radio has started.
The entire day this
radio will be on now!
This is Vividh Bharati!
Vividh Bharati!
Come on. - Okay, let's go. What
are you waiting for? - Come on!
I have taken the sweet with me!
Come on!
- Come! Come!
I am feeling sorry that I could
not see the Kanpur drama group.
How are you
Thakur's lady? What is it?
What can it be?
Today you are dressed up very well!
As if I have dressed up for you!
If you would dress up for me,
I would be very fortunate!
For the past twenty years
I have been watching you.
Mishra, did you see, the
attitude of beautiful sari?
Oh my God!
As if you have purchased it for me!
Me? You should have told me once.
Then instead of this cotton sari..
..I would've bought you
a beautiful silk sari.
My husband is there for me! I
will wear whatever he gives me.
You think about your age.
Have some shame.
You too are not lass anymore!
You already have grand children.
You dress up more than
the youngsters do nowadays!
You come out of the
house only to glare..
..at all the dressed up
ladies of the village?
He has this habit since his youth.
How will he do away with that?
Yes! Mr. Mishra, you are no less.
That is why you
always accompany him..
..so that even you
enjoy a little bit of fun.
Now just see, Thakur lady..
I have seen, I have seen!
Here.. take your token.
Uncle, what is it?
Are you fine now?
My dear, I am always fine!
At times I cannot control my
heart that is another thing!
Now the doctor has
made you very healthy.
Can anyone looking at you
say that you were sick..
..for so many days?
The doctor has
really done a miracle.
Another miracle is that
the doctor did not take..
..any money from him
for the medicines.
If he has not taken
then he will take now.
The doctor is not a fool.
He will take double the amount.
That is if uncle gives.
He will have to give now,
what do you say, uncle?
If I have to give, I
will give! What do you say?
Just see, the moment we thought
about him the doctor has arrived.
Come, doctor! Come here!
Uncle, the doctor has
told the entire village..
..that the medicine was worth Rs.
500 besides the efforts he put in.
Just be careful!
I am careful! Of course.
He has spent Rs. 500!
Come, come, doctor!
- Come, please come!
Come doctor, please come!
Greetings! - Please sit! - Come!
- Greetings, doctor!
Please sit! Brother, please move!
- Please, be seated.
Greetings, Mr. Tiwari.
- Greetings!
Tell me how are you feeling now?
I am absolutely fine by your grace.
Do you have any problems now?
- No pain at all!
Doctor, there is a great problem..
..even though uncle does not
want to say it. - What is it!
You have cured him but you did
not charge anything from him.
Brother, I have come
today to ask for it.
Then ask for it! Ask by all means!
Uncle has not given a single
farthing to anyone till date.
Today you ask for all that
you want. Rs. 500! Rs. 1000!
I do not want money!
Then take a plot of land!
Transfer a grove in your name.
Ask for an ox!
Hey Anurodh, do not talk nonsense!
Have you seen the baton?
Uncle, what did I say? He only said
that he does not want any money.
Let him ask for whatever he wants.
Just by me saying is
not going to work.
Whatever I say, you will
have to accept it too.
Yes! First say, yes!
Speak! Now you are trapped!
No.. doctor! I will
not go against your word.
I will do whatever I can.
Get Omkar married to my daughter.
Accept my daughter as
your daughter-in-law!
If you want any dowry then..
No! No! Doctor! Do not
talk of dowry with me.
That tradition which
is ruining the society..
..I stay away from it.
You selected my son, you
asked for him, I gave him.
Now where does dowry come into it?
So now the wedding is finalized!
"Groom, oh groom."
"Groom, oh groom."
"Until the seven
rounds are complete.."
"Until the seven
rounds are complete.."
"..till then a bride is
not considered married."
"..till then a groom is
not considered married."
"No.. Until the seven
rounds are complete.."
"Groom, this is the first round."
"Sister, the
destination is very far."
"This is the first round.
The destination is very far."
"You have to toil all night."
"Until the seven
rounds are complete.."
"..till then a bride is
not considered married."
"..till then a groom is
not considered married."
"No.. Until the seven
rounds are complete.."
"As she takes rounds, she is
going away from her house."
"Every round makes new relatives."
"She is going away from her house.
Makes new relatives."
"A happy life ahead and
sorrow of separation."
"Until the seven
rounds are complete.."
"..till then a bride is
not considered married."
"..till then a groom is
not considered married."
"No.. Until the seven
rounds are complete.."
"Groom, oh groom."
"Complete the seven rounds and
fulfill the seven promises too."
"How will a girl like this
sacrifice everything for you?"
"Complete the seven rounds and
fulfill the seven promises too."
"How will a girl like this
sacrifice everything for you?"
"Hey bride, see the pole star."
"Let your married life
be like a pole star."
"Hey bride, see the pole star."
"Let your married life
be like a pole star."
"Seven rounds and
companionship of seven births."
"Until the seven
rounds are complete.."
"..till then a bride is
not considered married."
"..till then a groom is
not considered married."
Priest. - Yes.
Are all the rituals here over?
- Yes, they are over!
Then shall we take the bride
and the groom to the room?
Yes, you can take them.
- Please help the girl.
O groom, you cannot so
easily go into the room.
Here you have to complete a ritual.
Recite a poem, a couplet
or a verse that you know.
My dear, recite something.
Fulfill the ritual of
crossing the threshold.
Here the mother-in-law
gives money to the son-in-law.
O groom, are you deaf or are
you remembering your sister?
Why should we remember our sister?
We do not have any sister.
We have come here to take
away someone else's sister.
This boy is very smart.
If he is smart then let him speak.
His brother does not
look like he is educated.
Did you not find out
before the wedding?
So what if we did not know
earlier now we will know..
..in front of everyone.
You are also not still married.
You only recite something.
Yes, recite something. Then you
too will get married to Gunja.
Keep quiet!
- The pair will suit each other.
'Nobody understands the
ways of someone in love.'
'It radiates more the
more it immerses in love.'
Take my dear.
Come on! - The younger brother
too should recite something.
The younger brother
will not recite anything.
You will have to recite.
- Great!
You are ordering me
like a school teacher!
Yes. Am I any less than a teacher?
Listen to me and recite something.
- You will get money for that.
Hey Gunjiya, leave the door,
it is getting late.
Take my dear, you take
money just like that.
Saw that? He
immediately took the money.
My dear, join this with love,
it is for eternal life.
Take this!
- Now you only keep this!
That's it! Now all the
rituals here are over.
Now take care of
your brother-in-law.
Brother-in-law, come!
- Aunt, please come!
My dear, sit down!
- Aunt, come!
Brother, sit down.
Brother-in-law, take this,
this is the venerated betel nut.
Keep this in your mouth.
No! No! No! Do not
keep this in your mouth.
Great! Why are you stopping him?
This is part of the ritual.
To give a left over
betel nut is also a ritual!?
Who's left over?
Sister-in-law! I know everything.
On the wedding day the
bride keeps a betel nut..
..in her mouth the whole day.
Am I right, sister-in-law? See!
- Just give me a little rice.
You knew about this?
- Yes! - Okay!
Give me another plate.
Okay, now tell me how much
rice is there in this plate?
Why? - First you tell
me then I will tell you.
No, you first tell me.
- You are very stubborn!
If what you say is
right then you win..
..and you will get
that much amount of money.
What if it is wrong?
Then you lose. If you lose
then you will have to do..
..whatever I ask you to.
Why are you staring at me?
Tell me! Measure the rice.
It must be ten palms full!
What it must be? It is!
Then measure it!
- Yes! Yes! I will measure it!
One!
- Okay! - This is two! - Two!
And this is three!
- Three!
Four.. four..
- You lost? Now?
Now what? Tell me
what will I have to do?
Okay, I will tell you someday.
But remember that! - Okay!
Now it is brother-in-law's turn.
My brother can never be wrong.
We will not tell him to
measure the rice. - Then?
I will tell you just now.
We will throw a ring
three times in this water.
The one who wins between
sister and brother-in-law..
..the other one will have
to listen to that person.
There.. start!
There!
- Sister, find it quickly!
Hey.. this is cheating!
- I will take my sister's side.
Why don't you take your
brother's side and make him win?
Brother! Catch her
hand only! Catch the ring!
What is the use of
catching the hand?
My sister has the ring in her hand.
So what? Now this hand
too belongs to my brother.
What do you say, sister-in-law?
Is this going to
continue all night..
..or are you children
going to eat something?
Go and get water!
Take my dear, eat!
If I do not look after
everything in this house..
..then no job can be done!
First I had Rupa's help,
but now she is going away.
The one now left is Gunja.
Let me see how things work out.
Come, Rupa, you too eat something.
Come!
Look.. serve them properly!
The groom always
feels shy the first time.
Understood? Come!
Hey, this is not that water!
Take.. drink!
Hey boy, this is your capacity?
- Why?
You could not even
finish this meal?
For whom have you left
this offering? - For you!
Bride, this is Mrs.
Mishra. From our village.
Take her blessings.
- God bless you!
She is her niece, Rajjo!
Greetings!
Hey Tiwari, now your daughter-in-law
has come to your house.
Give at least an
indication before entering now!
Sister-in-law, I made a mistake.
Henceforth I will make a habit.
Give up your old habit
of looking at ladies.
You know so many
ladies are sitting here.
You just barged in!
Madam Thakur, I swear if I have
looked at anyone else besides you.
Hey Tiwari, at
least have some shame.
Now a daughter-in-law has come
to your house. Just go from here.
This is his old habit,
he will never change.
My dear, what to do?
After many years a daughter-in-law
has come into this house.
I am very happy.
I coughed and then entered.
- Just see!
I will take this cot..
- Go, brother, go!
Come on, we too will go now.
So soon?
- Yes!
Omkar! Hey, Omkar!
What?
- What are you asking!
Go in, the bride is
sitting all alone.
We all are going away!
Yes, I am going in!
Then go! We are going!
Come on! Come on!
Hey! Why are you looking
over there?
It's your turn next.
Go away!
- Why?
After seeing the
wedding procession..
..you too must have wished
to become the groom right?
No.. no! Not at all!
I feel like..
- You feel like? - Yes!
Then go and tell Mr. Mishra!
You too come along and
tell him. It will be better.
Why should I? You wish it,
you go and speak.
Okay, at least come to
drop me to the house.
Look over there, they are
all going, you go with them.
I am feeling very sleepy!
Okay! You go to sleep!
Hey, where are you? Listen!
Coming!
Take this!
- What is this?
Taste it at least.
I will definitely eat it! I
will say one thing. - What?
You are spoiling all my habits.
- Why?
Just see, first we used to eat
anything that we could make.
We are eating such tasty food now.
Is that so? I was
worried as to what happened.
Is this a small matter?
Rupa, this is a very big thing.
Really! I now realize that there
was a lot lacking in our life.
I was alone running
the entire house somehow.
Now that you have come, we
will together run the house.
Really, everything has
changed so suddenly!
The days have changed, the
nights too have changed. Isn't it?
Now do not waste time talking.
Finish it up.
I will eat this! Wait!
Oh!
- Where are you going?
You too have a little.
No! No! I will eat later!
- No! Why later?
You are trying to run away? Eat it!
Brother, Ramjanak
is standing outside.
He wants to know whether
you are going to the fields..
..or should he go alone.
- Brother, why won't I go?
If I do not work hard then
what will I feed my wife?
Listen.. I am going!
- I will also drink from this.
Hey! Do not drink water!
First eat this.
Wow! Sweet porridge!
Did you eat? - No.
Why?
- After uncle comes and eats it.
Sister-in-law, uncle
has no fixed time.
You do not keep waiting for
uncle to eat, I am telling you.
He just cannot stay hungry.
If at all he feels hungry, he
will come and eat by himself.
No.. this does not look good.
Everything looks good!
Sister-in-law, you must be
remembering Gunja a lot?
You might not like to
stay here right? - Why?
You are here to give me company.
Your nature is just like hers.
Sister-in-law, but where
do you know me that much?
I have heard from your brother.
What?
- A lot!
He was saying he can
never get a brother like you.
No, sister-in-law! Brother
loves me immensely that is why..
..he says this.
Sister-in-law, to
tell you the truth..
..only fortunate people
gets brother like him.
I heard that daughter-in-law
has made tasty sweet today?
Uncle, she did but now it is over.
Hey! I did not even eat it,
how did it get over?
Like this!
You naughty!
Here.. take this!
God bless you! Are there no
fried bread along with this?
If you do not like the
sweet without the fried bride..
..then give it back.
I will eat it! I will eat it!
Today sister-in-law
gave you, so eat it.
But henceforth be
careful of your diet.
Otherwise sister-in-law
will have to stay hungry.
No my dear, you need not worry.
From today I will be
the first person to eat.
Not first, say a little early!
- Yes, quickly!
Hey! Not so quickly!
Not so quickly!
Chandan! Hey, Chandan!
Yes, sister-in-law, what is it?
I do not know where
everything is kept like.
Just see how everything
is thrown around. - Yes!
Come on help me, so we
will clean everything.
So shall I keep all
these things out? - Yes! Yes!
Okay?
- Yes! - I will do it just now.
Here, take this! Take this!
This will break, isn't it?
You hold this! - Yes!

You did not go to
Balihar for quite a few days.
Yes, I did not have
any work there. Why?
We would get some news
about Rupa at least.
Father, you bring sister home.
It's been so many days
that I have met her.
I really feel like meeting her.
Father, get her home.
Yes uncle, get her home.
How will I get her just like that?
- Why?
What do you know? There are many
things to do in a farmer's house.
She is busy in her
family and she is happy too.
What more do we want?
Hey, it was my turn.
- Take this.
He was saying..
Sister-in-law! Why are
you sitting like this?
What is the matter?
Are you not feeling well?
What can be wrong with my health?
- Then?
Nothing is wrong with me.
Then why are you sitting
so forlorn?
Why do you think that I look sad?
I was a little tired,
so I was resting.
If you are tired then sit down,
where are you going?
I have got to work as well.
What work? You
tell me. I will do it.
What will you do?
He is right. Do not work
so much in this condition..
..that you get tired.
- Yes.
Get me a sister-in-law,
then I will not work so much.
Daughter-in-law, you
will get a sister-in-law.
Just have patience.
I was thinking that
Chandan should first know..
..everything about the farming.
One field is looked after by Omkar.
When he learns to look
after another field..
..then just see with great
pomp we will get him married.
Tell me the truth, are you
really not feeling well?
If there is any problem then shall
we call the doctor immediately?
In such conditions, it is
not right to ignore yourself.
Uncle, I was saying..
..can I call my younger
sister here for a few days?
What is your opinion?
What opinion? It is a great idea.
I did not even think of this.
With this, much of our
troubles will be solved.
What Omkar, what do you say?
- Okay!
Okay? Then send Chandan to get her.
Mother! Mother! Chandan has come!
Come, come, my dear!
Why do you feel shy to
enter your own house?
God bless you!
Sit down!
- Yes!
Are you crazy? He is your
sister's brother-in-law.
You will make him sit
on a bare cot like this?
Go in and get some bed
sheet and cover this.
No! This is fine!
Oh my God! The slippers
are smeared with dust..
..as if you came
here playing in dust.
Can't you walk properly
on the path?
Who was paying
attention on the path?
All my attention was
on my destination.
How did you remember
destination today?
Are you going to
stand here talking..
..or you are going to
serve him something?
He has come from a far off place.
He must be thirsty.
Yes, mother. I am very thirsty.
Go! Go and bring the cool water
from the well and make sherbet.
I am going. First tell
me how my sister is?
First give me water to drink!
- No! First tell me.
First water!
- No! - No!
You go! Go and fill water and come.
God knows when this
girl will become sensible!
Has the doctor gone
to some other village?
No.. he is in the village, I
will call him just now. - Okay!
Kulashree, just go and tell
someone to call Gunja's father..
He must be at the
Thakur's place for a meeting.
Okay, aunt.
Is everything fine at home?
Everyone is fine! Absolutely fine!
This.. this letter..
sister-in-law has sent it.
Okay..
Beware! If you put
your hand in the water!
You will have to
fill the bucket again!
Why have you come?
To take away someone!
- To take away? - Yes!
Whom?
Whom do you go to take
from your in-law's house?
Keep quiet!
Here.. take, make the sherbet.
Tell me, will you go to Balihar?
Balihar? Why?
Your sister has called for you.
What did I say? You just
do not believe what I say.
You sit and drink sherbet. I
will go and prepare a meal.
In the meantime, her
father too will come.
Then you have your lunch
and make preparations to go.
Okay. - Okay.
Tie your veil properly!
Give, I will do it for you.
You are going there, tie
your sari properly. Understood?
Whenever you go out,
wear a sari. Ok.
Here.. cover your
head with the veil.
Take it properly.
Yes.. catch it!
Come, dear Gunja, we are
getting late! - Coming!
Coming father!
- Go!
Stay nicely!
- Yes, mother.
Okay my dear!
- Come soon!
Okay! - My child, come on,
go quickly! - Go carefully!
Okay! Give my regards to sister.
- Okay!
Gunja, are you going to your
in-laws house? - Keep quiet!
Gunja! Hey Gunja!
- What is it?
At least say something!
You are really sitting
like a newly married bride.
Now only one thing is lacking.
- Lacking? What is lacking?
You did not cry loudly to
inform the entire village.
Does anyone ever cry to
inform the village? - Then?
Great! Don't you feel sad
when you leave your house?
Are you feeling sad?
All the time you
just keep blabbering.
I have a habit of making
fun and teasing others.
You do not like me talking
like this? What? Tell me!
What should I say?
- Just answer me.. yes or no!
I do not want to give an answer.
Are you angry?
Okay, forget about crying!
Sing something.
What?
- Yes, sing!
You sing very well!
Who told you that?
- Sister-in-law!
You were singing in
the wedding too.
I do not sing alone.
- Then?
I sing along with my friends.
You sing, I will sing with you too.
You?
- What happened?
What if you cannot sing with me?
Then once again I
will accept defeat.
You at least start singing. - No.
- Hey!
Sing. Sing. - No.
Hey Gunja, sing.
"Which direction you
are taking me to?"
"Which direction you

Is Balihar still very far?
No! There it is!
Right ahead of you!
Why? You are scared
because it is getting dark?
I never get scared! Give me.
You want some more? - Enough.
Chandan, if I feel
lonely in Balihar..
..then will you
drop me to Chaubepur?
You will feel lonely even
though I will be there with you?
What is your relation with me?
You are asking me?
- Yes! You! I am asking you!
Okay, you tell me! Come here!
If some third person
comes here and asks you..
..what is your relation with me?
Then what answer will you give him?
I?
- Yes!
No one can come here first of all!
How do you know that
no one will come here?
Suppose if someone does come, then?
How's that possible?
If you say I will clap
just now and call. - To whom?
Look over there! That Acacia tree.
A man will come down from that tree.
Which man stays on that tree?
There is.. a ghost!
- Ghost!
You were just now saying
that you do not get scared!
Okay, okay, come on. - No!
I was just making fun! - No!
Come, Rajjo, sit down!
Sister-in-law, where is Chandan?
Chandan has gone to Chaubepur.
To bring my sister.
- Why?
I have called her
here for a few days.
She will come and take
over the household chores.
Otherwise who else would do it?
Why? If you would have
told me wouldn't I do it?
Sister-in-law, you
think I am a stranger?
Forget it! Forget it! At
your aunt's and uncle's place..
..you do not do anything
then what will you do here?
If need arises I can do everything!
Yes, when you will
do it, we will see.
Come, Gunja! Come!
Sister, I have come!
Gunja!
Chandan, you were late!
Yes, brother, on the
way we stopped to eat..
Greetings, brother-in-law.
- Great!
You embraced your
sister so lovingly..
..and to me only greetings?
Come, come and greet me.
Hey! God bless you! God bless you!
Gunja!
- Yes!
She is Rajjo!
- Greetings!
And this aunt!
Greetings!
- Be happy! God bless you!
Sister, where are you going?
- To prepare food. You sit!
Have I come here to sit?
I will prepare it.
You have just come, at
least sit for a while. - No!
Just show me the kitchen!
I.. I will show you!
This is the kitchen.
- Come on.
Rajjo, did you see? A girl
who knows work is like this.
Bride, your sister is very smart.
Chandan! - Yes.
- Come!
Tell me, do you have
any work? - No.
I will talk to Gunja!
Is she going to run away? She
will be here for a few days.
You do one thing! Now you go home.
You come tomorrow morning and
talk to her as much as you wish.
Let her sit! - You do not know.
Now as soon as it is dark..
..she will tell me drop me home.
So, what will happen
if you drop me home?
Why do you
unnecessarily want to sit here?
Moreover, I am also tired.
What about you, you
gossiped here and there..
..and your day gets passed by.
Why do you say that?
She can understand
only if I say like this.
Am I right or not?
Where is turmeric?
Turmeric is in that first jar.
Gunja, I will go now! Okay?
- Come tomorrow, okay?
I will definitely come, you have come
to our village for the first time.
I will take you around to
show our village, okay? - Okay!
Hey.
You couldn't solve
such simple riddle!?
Please repeat it.
'One lady has two
children both of the same color.
One walks and one waits
even then they are together.'
It is so simple!
Give me some clue.
Some clue? It is
in everyone's house.
And no one can do without that.
- Yes!
In everyone's house?
- Yes!
I know!
- What?
Grinding stone, isn't it?
- Yes!
Now I will ask you!
- Yes, ask me, ask me.
Now enough! Enough!
It is very late now.
We have to sleep, in the morning
we have to go to the fields.
Uncle, let her ask just one more.
Then it will be equal!
Then you keep talking, I am going.
Where are you going in the kitchen,
we have finished eating our food.
Okay, come on ask, ask quickly!
'There is a river in between a boat
and a boat in between a river.'
What? Is this any riddle?
You just say anything.
How can I just say anything?
I know the answer!
Why should I accept what you say?
- Then you give me the answer!
Yes, yes, I will give an answer!
Wait! I will give the answer!
Do you know.. boat in the river..
Eyes! Eyes! Eyes! Yes! Eyes! Eyes!
No! Sister told you!
Sister told you!
Sister-in-law is mine,
so what if she tells?
Brother!
- Yes, Chandan!
Now we will stop! We
will go home for lunch!
Right now?
- Yes!
The sun has not yet risen properly!
That.. no.. it has
not risen, isn't it?
Brother, what to do,
I am very hungry.
Really, I am very hungry.
Looks like in the morning in a
hurry you ate very little breakfast.
Come on, no problem!
What? Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Lovely my child, you
really prepare tasty food.
I feel I should just keep eating.
There was one Shukla
in our village.
I remembered his food today.
'Four vessels in four directions.'
'Two here and two there!'
'Two were hidden behind him.'
'Then he kept on asking.. kept
on asking.. kept on asking.'
Come on serve me! Fill up the bowl.
Add a little ghee too.
Enough!
- Shall I serve you a little more?
No! No! Not to me. Give Chandan!
- Okay!
No! No! Enough! Enough!
Chandan, what is the matter?
You were saying that you
are very hungry over there.
Why are you eating so slowly now?
Tasty food is eaten like this.
- Yes!
By relishing it! The way I do.
Take some more.
- Enough! Enough! I am full.
Come on, shall we get up?
- Yes!
Then come on!
I enjoyed the food today.
Gunja, now serve yourself.
I will eat later!
Why later, eat now.
First you finish eating.
I have finished eating!
Finish eating this first.
What?
- Nothing!
Gunja! Hey Gunja!
- Coming, sister!
Sister, what is it?
Just go and call aunt!
- Yes!
Hey Tiwari!
Congratulations! Congratulations!
Omkar is blessed with a son!
Oh brother!
Congratulations! Congratulations!
Congratulations!
Hey Ramjanak, I
have become an uncle!
Uncle, congratulations! Now
there is a grandson in the house.
Congratulations!
- Now at least empty your pockets.
Shall I make some more? - Enough!
Enough! They are more than enough!
Show me my grandson's face today.
Oh my! First give me my gift!
Madam Thakur, today I will
give you whatever you ask for.
Have this sweet from me.
Open your mouth and eat it!
Hey Tiwari!
- Yes!
Here, see your grandson's face.
- Yes! Give, give me, aunt.
He is very handsome!
He just looks like Omkar!
Yes.. uncle!
Aunt, now my life is blessed.
Once Chandan gets
married now then what..
..we will have many
grandchildren playing here.
I will play with them
and sing the Lord's praise.
Bring!
Hey Anurodh!
- Yes, uncle!
The Holi fire should be lit so
high that 12 other villages..
..should see the illumination.
Yes.. in the night we will
bring your cot and burn it..
..there will be a very big fire.
Quiet!
Hey Mrs. Thakur!
- What is it?
Come a little closer!
- Tell me!
The month of Phagun is
for locking eyes together.
This Holi day, why were
you sneaking away quietly?
Why do you wish to injure
yourself in this old age?
He is injured since his youth!
Whenever he sees you his
old wounds open up! - Yes!
You too are injured! Both
of you can heal each other.
Oh! See her gait!
Uncle! You have still
not gone to the barn.
If you go, only then
brother-in-law and Chandan..
..can come home
and apply sandalwood.
Otherwise, will they apply it
after the Holi fire is lit up?
Yes.. I am going, but
where are you wandering around?
I had come to Rajjo's house,
I am going home now.
Yes, go home!
Is it done?
- Yes!
Chandan!
- Yes, brother!
I will go and get the bullock cart!
- Okay!
You come later! Fine?
- Okay, brother!
Gunja! Apply it on him!
- Yes!
Why don't you apply it?
My back is aching! Now I can't sit!
Here!
Who would want to apply
turmeric with these rough hands?
Your legs are so rough.
My hands will get scrapped.
You have attitudes of a prince!
Go and bring some girl
with delicate hands!
Ask her to apply it!
Gunja, apply it! Why do
you take this fool seriously?
Am I a fool?
It's good that she came.
Otherwise you would have
had to cook both the times.
Sister-in-law, look at this!
- What happened?
She is pulling at my hair!
- What can I do?
The hair gets stuck!
How is that possible?
Its not locks of hair.
Then you only do it!
Do it, Gunja! We are getting late!
Take this.
- Sister!
Now what happened? - Look at
your brother-in-law's deeds!
You too look at your
sister's doing! Look!
Holi fire is still not lit up..
..and already you two have
started playing with colors!
Fine! I will show you how to
play Holi in Balihar tomorrow!
It's Holi!
Sister-in-law!
What happened?
Early in the morning why did
you adorn your face? - Adorn?
Look at your face in the mirror!
Sister-in-law! - Yes?
- Where is Gunja?
Gunja has gone to play
Holi with the girls!
I think she is at Rajjo's place.
It's Holi!
Smear color as much as you want!
Then I will show you!
You!
Now show me!
- Nothing!
At least apply a dot!
You have colors in your hand!
Smear it on your face!
Fool!
Listen! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Where are you going?
What are you doing? Leave me!
Leave me!
Shameless! Are there
no men in your house?
They smeared colors!
It's gone in my ears!
Chandan, where are you going?
Don't you want to
play Holi with the gang?
Yes! I am coming!
Listen! Listen!
- Yes!
Did you see Gunja anywhere?
Yes! Just now she passed this way!
I think she is at
brother Raghunath's house!
All the women have gone there.
- Let's go! - Come on!
Do you know? I painted beard..
..moustache on his face!
- Is that so? - And then..
Sister, don't tell him I am here!
You wait here! I will just come!
- Okay! Fine!
Come, Chandan!
Sister-in-law, is Gunja here?
- Yes! She is here!
Want to meet her?
- Yes!
Come!
Here! Aunt, somebody
has come to meet you!
Who is it?
- It's me..
Chandan! Greetings!
It's Holi! It's Holi!
God bless you, dear!
It's Holi!
- Met her?
It's Holi!
Chandan! Listen!
Gunja is here! Chandan, wait!
She made fun of me!
- Just see!
Am I playing some drama!
- Yes! - What does she think!
Where are you going?
- Sister-in-law..
Come on!
"O dear, go slow."
"Wow, dear!"
"By the river bank."
"Wow, dear!"
"Few look for a gem
and few for pearls."
"I look for my damsel."
"Please find her, somebody."
"Wow, dear!"
"Please make me meet her."
"Wow, dear!"
"Spring has arrived
with its usual jest."
"Do spurt colors on each other."
"The ascetic with his
musical instrument.."
"..passes by the window."
"O dear!"
"O dear, I can't sleep."
"Wow, dear!"
"I miss my beloved."
"Wow, dear!"
"I'm diagnosed of the
disease called love."
"Let me know if
there's any remedy to it."
"This dreadful disease.."
"Wow, dear!"
"It's spread all over."
"Wow, dear!"
"The village damsels have
showered me with color."
"She hid, the one
who I got trapped to."
"I've no interest in this
world as she hid herself."
"I've no interest in this
world as she hid herself."
"Without spurting her with color.."
"Wow, dear!"
"I'm afraid this
spring season may pass by."
"Wow, dear!"
"Few look for a gem
and few for pearls."
"I look for my damsel."
"Please find her, somebody."
"Wow, dear!"
"Please make me meet her."
"Wow, dear!"
"The damsel goes hiding.."
"..her lover fails to trace her."
"The lover asks for the reason.."
"..to feel shy on this day."
"What's it to do with shyness as
the whole village is playing Holi?"
"What's it to do with shyness as
the whole village is playing Holi?"
"I'm already drenched in color."
"Wow, dear!"
"What's the delay in union?"
"Wow, dear!"
"I've become a victim of love."
"Let me know if
there's a remedy to it."
"This is a dreadful disease."
- "Wow, dear!"
"One loses interest in the world."
- "Wow, dear!"
"The identity of my
lover is her sea-deep eyes."
"She makes me go
restless with her looks."
"I'm eager to have a
look at her eyes."
"I'm eager to have a
look at her eyes."
"The teenage years are about
to pass by." - "Wow, dear!"
"The youth is about to arrive."

"If yours is a true love."
- "Wow, dear!"
"Kid, you'll find your girl."
- "Wow, dear!"
"The black magic and getting hurt.."
"..is nothing compared to love."
"The stuff that can
have a control over it.."
"..give me such thing."
"Dear, give such thing
that my beloved is impressed."
"Dear, give such thing
that my beloved is impressed."
"Following us."
- "Wow, dear!"
"He comes with eyes shut."
- "Wow, dear!"
"I'm diagnosed of the
disease called love."
"Let me know if
there's any remedy to it."
"This dreadful disease.."
- "Wow, dear!"
"It's spread all over."
- "Wow, dear!"
"O dear, go slow."
- "Wow, dear!"
"Passing by the river bank."
- "Wow, dear!"
"Please find her, somebody.
- Wow, dear!"
"Please get us united.
- Wow, dear!"
"If your love's true. - Wow, dear!"
"Kid, you'll surely find her.
- Wow, dear!"
Look at this..!
What's this, brother?
It's Holi! It's Holi!
Now I got hold of you!
- I have taken a bath!
Why did you take a bath?
Where were you since morning?
Do you know how much
I searched for you?
If I had met you, I would
have got you drenched in colors.
I..
I see!
Wait!
- Sister!
Now you are calling your sister!
- Sister!
Sit here!
Now see my Holi!
Look, sister!
- What?
You both are the same!
Chandan, go!
You go and take a bath!
Bring two buckets of
water for her too!
Go!
- Yes!
Come!
Gunja! You played Holi
with the entire village!
But you didn't play with me!
Honestly! I had the first right to
play Holi with my sister-in-law!
So, play it now!
- Now what?
Already you are smeared in color.
How will I smear color on you?
Come!
You wanted to play Holi
with me after taking a bath?
My Holi wouldn't have been complete
without playing it with you.
Can I ask you something now?
- Yes.
What is my relationship with you?
The relationship formed
without saying anything..
..what name to give it?
You tell me.
- Shall I?
I know it. You know it.
Why the details?
Gunja..
There was silence in the court!
There was only silence!
Uncle!
- Yes, dear!
Can I ask you something?
- Yes, dear.
Do you know what's going
on at home?
What happened?
Is Gunja going to stay
here forever?
Why are you worried?
Wait! She is right!
Rajjo, did Gunja
say something to you?
What if she didn't say anything?
Do you remember when she had come?
Sister-in-law gave birth to
a child! She played Holi too!
I don't see any reason of
her putting up here any longer!
What happened, dear?
You won't wear bangles?
No.
- Take it.
No. - You were looking
at it. - No! Let's go!
Buy it!
- No!
Buy it on my insistence! Come!
Come!
Which one do you like?
How would the yellow look?
I will like whatever you wear!
Give me this one!
How many?
- How many!
All of it!
- All of it? - Yes! All of it!
How much?
- 4 rupees!
4 rupees!
- Will you wear it now?
No. I will wear it later. Give.
Dear, buy this bindi (forehead
dot) too. It will suit your face.
No! - It's only for 50 paisa.
No! I don't put such bindis!
Here is 4 rupees and this too.
Look.. how is it?
It's really nice. Now wear this!
What?
- Bindi!
I told you! I don't put a bindi!
Someday you will right!
Then why do you feel shy?
C'mon. Let me also
see as to how it looks.
Wow! It looks really nice!
How do I know! How can I see it?
- Look into my eyes!
I see only one thing in your eyes.
- What?
The thing that lies in your heart.
It's only you Gunja..
Let it remain in your heart.
Tell me when it's the right time.
Look at both of us. You
will like it more. - Shut up.
'The moon far away, it
cooks delicious dish.'
'You have it in a plate and give
the same to the baby in a bowl.'
'The baby got upset
as the bowl broke.'
'The moon far away, it
cooks delicious dish.'
'You have it in a plate and give
the same to the baby in a bowl.'
'The moon far away, it
cooks delicious dish.'
'You have it in a plate..'
'You have it in a plate and give
the same to the baby in a bowl.'
Will you make him cry? Why
are you pinching his cheeks?
You are feeling jealous?
Shall I pinch yours too..
Fool!
Uncle, you didn't come for lunch?
Mrs. Mishra asked me to stay
for lunch and I had it there.
Gunja!
- Yes!
Get water for me! - I will
just get it! - My dear child!
My dear child!
Uncle!
- Yes, dear!
I was wondering why not
plant sugarcane in a few fields.
Okay! Plant it!
- Here, uncle!
God bless you, dear.
- I too want a glass of water!
You couldn't have said it before?
Now go and help yourself.
Omkar!
- Yes, uncle!
All my work has got over smoothly.
Gunja should be sent
back to her home now.
Doctor is a decent man.
He won't say anything.
Her mother must be
having trouble over there.
The girl has adjusted
so well here..
..that nobody can
say she is an outsider.
It's Tuesday tomorrow.
It's an auspicious day.
Send her home.
Chandan.
What happened?
Why are you so quiet?
Nothing!
- Tell me the truth!
What happened to you?
Say something.
What's the use of talking to
the person who is leaving!
What are you saying? I
had to go back home right?
So what? My heart
will remain right there.
That's why..
I don't like it at all!
If you will think of good things,
you will feel better.
Just think of the happy
days we spent together.
You will laugh when
you will remember it.
What happened?
- Look down!
What is this?
- The color should be strong!
Fool!
- What fool?
Someday I have to apply colors!
Why are you feeling shy?
When the time will come,
I won't feel shy.
You will feel shy at that time.
Right?
Look, isn't that Deepasatti tree?
- Yes!
People say that if you wish
something from Deepasatti..
..then it always comes true.
You too ask for something.
For whom?
- Yourself! Who else?
What like?
- Anything you feel like!
Fine!
Deepasatti!
- Not like this! Fold your hands!
I did fold it! I will do it again!
Deepasatti! If you get Gunja
married to the man of her choice..
..then I will offer sweets.
You are joking here too!
I am not joking!
If you marry the man you like,
then I will get everything.
Fool!
"O Gunja.."
"O Gunja.."
"Chandan.."
"We both got lost in each other."
"We are made for each other."
"God knows when we'll be
able to tie the knot."
"O Gunja.."
"Chandan.."
"The water in the
river forms waves."
"The love in me is
getting restless."
"The water in the
river forms waves."
"The love in me is
getting restless."
"How come did this happen?"
"God knows! - He knows
when will the time arrive.."
"..when we'll tie the knot."
"O Gunja.."
"Chandan.."
"I got lost in your dream,
your fragrance is all I breathe."
"I got lost in your dream,
your fragrance is all I breathe."
"Stamp the color on
your feet on mine."
"I'll be able to pass my
day in the shadow of colors."
"Let's pray to the roots
of the old banyan tree."
"Let's offer our
veneration to the tree."
"Let's pray to the roots
of the old banyan tree."
"Let's offer our
veneration to the tree."
"It'll bless us and
we'll soon get married."
"God knows!
- He knows when we'll get.."
"..to tie the knot."
"O Gunja..
- Chandan.."
"Gunja..
- Chandan.."
"We both got lost in each other."
"We are made for each other."
"God knows when we'll be
able to tie the knot."
"Gunja..
- Chandan.."
"Gunja..
- Chandan.."
When will you show me my
grandson's face, Chandan?
The boat is ready. You
can see him right now.
How can I go there? Tell Rupa
to come here for a few days.
I will tell her.
Dear, you too visit us.
We will keep getting
news of that place.
Surely! I will leave now!
- Okay!
Goodbye! - Goodbye!
God bless you.
Then..
- Then?
When will you come again?
How can I say that?
It would have been so nice if
we too could fly like birds.
Chaubepur here.
Balihar across the lake.
I could fly whenever I wanted.
Both of us together!
My heart will surely fly here.
That won't make me
feel content right?
Gunja.
Chandan!
- Yes, brother!
Let's go home and have lunch.
No, brother, you have it!
- Why?
I am not hungry at all!
What's the matter? Are you fine?
Normally you would
feel hungry before noon!
What's wrong today?
I don't know, brother.
Do one thing.
You go and have lunch and
bring two bread slices for me.
No, no! You too come with me!
Otherwise, who will
answer your sister-in-law?
Come! Come!
What happened? Why
is he crying so much?
No idea! - You are his mother.
You must know.
Even father must know.
Give. I will make him giggle.
Uncle has come. Go and serve lunch.
- Okay.
Sister-in-law!
- Yes!
Sister-in-law.. today
Munna is crying a lot. - Yes.
I think he is not well.
I will do one thing.
I will go to
Chaubepur and bring medicine.
Why do you need medicine?
Kids do cry.
No, uncle. He is not fine.
Brother, look.
Uncle doesn't understand.
- I understand everything!
If you take the child in
your arms and caress him..
..then he will stop crying.
I will show you.
Omkar, bring him to me.
Come, dear. Come.
Look! Look! He has stopped crying!
Gunja! Gunja!
- Yes.
You have stopped
venturing out of the house.
Why are you standing here alone?
Nothing. Just like that.
I am talking to you and
you are looking there.
You say there's nothing as such!
Are you expecting someone to come?
- Yes.
Is he coming today?
No! Who will come?
Looking at the road
doesn't mean somebody will come.
Then what! Are you
thinking of leaving?
Why are you hiding?
When you have spoken the truth
then why don't you reveal it?
That you are waiting for Chandan.
He..
You can't hide it. You
will have to confess now!
You have lost your
heart at Balihar!
You have learnt
how to feel shy even!
Gunja, what happened?
You can't sleep?
I don't know.. You go to sleep.
You too sleep. Are you
thinking of something?
If you will think then
how will you fall asleep?
Go to sleep, dear.
Go to sleep. Sleep!
Chandan!
- Yes!
We are going to the temple.
Will you come?
No, brother. I don't
feel like going somewhere.
You people go. I am at home.
- Okay.
Come on.
Gunja!
You?
Gunja. - Yes.
Come.
Sit!
You too sit.
So you have remembered me today?
We remember the
person whom we forget.
I didn't forget you.
Why did you come
after so many days then?
I waited for you everyday.
Gunja, I know. But what to do?
I didn't get the chance to come.
Even uncle never falls sick that I
will get the excuse to come here.
Gunja, to tell you the truth..
Since the time you have come here..
..I don't like anything at all!
I feel like taking you away again.
So, take me.
- How?
By marrying me.
At this I feel like..
- What?
Chandan! Chandan! Chandan!
Chandan!
Where are you lost?
Your eyes were open. I passed by.
You didn't see me. I
called you. You didn't hear me.
What has happened to you?
Nothing..
- What were you thinking?
I? I was thinking..
I was thinking about you.
- Is that so?
Yes.
- What?
Come here. Sit.
You sit here for 5 minutes.
I will be back in an hour.
Okay.
Chandan, you? Come inside!
Come inside, dear.
Why did you come in the rains?
When I left from village..
It was not raining.
I was passing by. I thought..
You have caught cold.
Listen!
Come quickly!
Chandan, you!
Give him dry clothes and a sheet.
Dry these clothes.
- Okay.
And give him warm milk.
- Okay.
I will bring medicines.
- Okay.
Come. Come.
- Come.
Come, dear.
Dear, have the medicine.
Then eat the sweets
followed by warm milk.
First eat the sweets.
Gunja made it yesterday.
Earlier Gunja didn't
do any household chores.
She has learnt many
things at your house.
How is it? - It's delicious.
Did Gunja fight with you there?
No. Now..
Gunja praises every
person of that place.
She always talks of that place.
Even in her sleep, Gunja keeps
mumbling names of people over there.
Where is Gunja!? She
is nowhere to be seen.
She has gone to her granny's
place to attend a wedding.
She was supposed to return today.
She won't come in
these rains I guess.
Oh! - You stay here tonight.
What's the use now?
- Why?
No, no! I mean the rains have
stopped. So I will leave now.
Okay. As you wish.
It would have been better if
you had stayed back, dear.
Yes, aunt. I will come
next time to stay here.
My shirt.
Wait here! I will give you
another dose of medicine.
Have it at home.
Gunja!
- Chandan!
You have come, Gunja!
- Yes!
When did you come?
I came a long time ago.
- Are you angry with me?
I was but not anymore.
I will return with the joy..
..that I had come to
see you and I saw you.
I got to meet you.
Come. Let's sit for a while.
- Come.
Tell me.
- First you say it.
How is sister?
- She is fine.
And Munna?
- Fine.
And?
You tell me.
- What?
Anything you like.
That's the problem.
When I want to say many things..
then I can't speak.
Really!
Shall we leave?
Shall I leave now?
Brother!
- Where had you gone?
Brother, I was here only!
You see.. it started raining so..
Raining? It didn't rain.
- It didn't rain.
No, brother! Not here!
You see, while
strolling I went far ahead.
Far away from the village.
We were so worried.
Rajjo was saying, God
knows what had happened to you.
You were talking strangely to her.
Brother, you too believed Rajjo!
She herself talks strangely,
brother!
Is that so?
- Yes!
To get rid of her, I
made her sit here and left.
No problem. Let's have dinner.
- Yes, brother.
First have the offering.
- Yes.
Chandan!
- Yes!
Will you do me a favor?
- Yes, sister-in-law.
Will you take me to
Chaubepur tomorrow?
Chaubepur!
- Yes!
I miss everybody there.
Even mother wants to see Munna.
Okay. We will go.
Sister-in-law!
Sister-in-law, the cart is ready.
Munna! Come! You will go
to sister-in-law, won't you?
My dear child!
You will return soon, won't you?
I am going after a long time.
I will have to stay
there for a few days.
I won't be able to stay here alone.
Enough, dear. God
bless you. God bless you.
Give my regards to the doctor.
- Okay.
Are you going to your
parents' house? - Yes.
God bless you. Be happy.
Tell Gunja that I'm
missing her a lot.
Aunt! Even if sister-in-law forgot,
I will tell her.
Okay. Fine!
Carefully! Return soon!
Brother, I will leave now.
Aunt, bye!
Mother! Sister has come!
Sister! Munna is here!
Sister's son has come!
Come quickly!
Sister's son has come! Come to me!
Let's go to meet grandma!
Come! Come!
Rupa! Come, dear! How are you?
Sister!
You have come!
- How are you?
Father, come soon! Sister has come!
Come! Come!
- Come, sister! - Come!
How is Munna?
- Chandan! - Yes! - Come!
Yes, aunt! I am coming!
Mother, in the
morning you were saying..
..that somebody will come.
Look, sister has come.
Munna has come. Look!
He is so sweet! I told you right!
She is Phuleshwari!
Phuleshwari aunt!
She's a nice aunt of yours!
Gunja, give me too!
Come to me! Come to me!
I'm your granny.
Rupa! Your son is really beautiful!
Aunt..
No, no! Why are you crying?
Look, your grandma.
You didn't recognize your grandma.
No, no, no!
Come to me!
- Go!
What happened?
Chandan. Have sherbet.
What happened to Munna?
Why are you crying so much?
No, no, no! Don't cry! Don't cry!
No, no! What happened?
We will come some other day.
- Okay. I am leaving.
Come.
- Come on!
Let's go.
I will come some other day.
Gunja! Take the box inside
and change Munna's clothes.
Okay!
Give him to me!
- Come on, mother. Let's go inside.
Munna is crying.
- Gunja!
Let's go inside!
Gunja!
- What is it?
Go and sit there.
First tell me something.
- What?
Are you angry with me?
No. Why will I be angry?
So, what's the matter? Why do
you seem so different today?
It's been quite a while.
Forget talking to me,
you didn't even look at me.
So, I thought maybe
because of yesterday..
Why do you think like this?
- Then?
Then what!
How could I have sat with
you in front of everybody?
Won't I feel shy?
Earlier.. earlier
you didn't feel shy.
Didn't you talk to me
in front of everybody?
Didn't you ever come near me?
That was then. Now I
can't do all this.
Why?
- I told you.
It will be difficult to
talk and meet frequently now.
I can't live without meeting you.
You will have to.
What are you both talking?
Nothing, sister!
- What?
Chandan, tell me your feelings.
What? Nothing!
Nothing, sister-in-law.
Fine. Don't tell me. I
understood everything.
I realized today why you
seemed so lost after Gunja left.
Why you always used to find
excuses to come to Chaubepur.
To meet Gunja, right?
Sister-in-law!
Where are you going? Wait!
You tell me. Do you like Chandan?
Will you marry him?
Sister-in-law, why to
ask for the good deed?
Sister-in-law, get
me married to her.
I will be your servant all
my life. I will serve you.
I will do whatever
you say. You just..
Fine! Fine! Fine! Enough!
I will tell your brother and
fix everything when I go back.
I will tell father to get
you both married. Fine? Happy?
Sister-in-law! Listen!
No!
Why are you feeling shy now?
Now I will feel even more shy.
Don't come to meet me frequently.
Now I will come everyday.
- No!
Yes!
- No! - I will come! - No!
Remember.. you had lost a bet?
That you will have to
heed to whatever I say?
Yes, I lost. But.. - Then listen..
So now, we will meet
on our marriage day.
Fine! I will do that!
Uncle!
- Yes!
I was thinking of something.
- Tell me, dear.
Why don't we get Chandan married?
Dear, you said what I was
going to say. - Is that so?
I was going to tell
you the same thing.
So fix the alliance quickly.
- It's almost fixed.
Where?
- Here!
Tell me. How about
Rajjo for Chandan?
Rajjo! She is really nice!
They both gel well too! - Yes!
So, go and talk to
Mr. Mishra today.
I will go right now.
- Okay.
Chandan! Chandan!
Chandan, listen!
Rajjo!
- Chandan.. wait!
What are you doing here?
- I was waiting for you.
Why? - I want to give
you good news. Come down!
What happened? Tell me.
- My marriage has been fixed.
Really!
- Yes!
That's great news!
- Isn't it so?
Yes! - I knew it! You
will be happy to hear it!
The alliance was fixed today!
- Is that so?
Uncle wrote a letter to my father.
- Okay.
He will come to see
you in a day or two.
And he will fix the alliance.
Me?
- Yes!
Rajjo! What are you saying?
Your marriage with me?
- Yes! With you!
No, Rajjo! This can't happen!
- Why? Why not?
Look, Rajjo..
- No!
First answer me! Tell me!
What's the flaw in me?
Am I not a nice girl?
No, Rajjo! That is not so.
You are a nice girl.
You are really nice.
You are from my village.
I have known you since childhood.
We have played together.
We quarreled too.
But.. I never saw you in
that way. I never loved you.
What! You don't love me!
If you don't love me
then whom do you love?
How are you concerned?
No! You will have to tell me!
Tell me! Whom do you love?
I love Gunja, Rajjo.
Even Gunja loves me.
And.. and I.. till now I loved you.
What about that?
Rajjo! Rajjo, I have
only one heart. Not two.
When did I fell in love
with Gunja..
..even I didn't realize that.
Rajjo!
- Let it be!
I had to refuse. He wouldn't
have listened otherwise.
He wouldn't have listened.
- Is that so?
So I..
- What are you both whispering?
You both become
quiet when you saw me.
Nowadays you hear
other's whispering.
That's good.
Phuleshwari, if you are searching
for a groom, then tell me.
Really, sister. Get her
also married at Balihar.
It will be great.
Fine.
- Sister, you too.
No, no..
But I am telling you.
- What?
You didn't do the right thing
by talking about the bet. - Why?
Poor guy will keep craving!
- That's what I want. Let him crave.
Only then he will
appreciate our meetings.
You are so cold-hearted.
- At times you have to do it.
Towel!
Munna!
Sister! Sister!
- Munna!
Sister! Mother!
Chandan! Chandan!
Where is your brother Omkar?
He is inside. Why?
- Call him.
Your sister-in-law
fell down from the stairs.
She is bleeding a lot.
Her condition is critical.
What?
- Yes!
Hurry up!
- Brother!
Has he come?
Message has been sent to him,
sister. He will be here soon.
Munna..!
- Munna is here!
Munna!
- He is with me, sister!
Gunja!
- Yes!
Gunja!
Sister!
Father! Father!
- Father!
Sister is calling you!
What happened, dear? What is it?
Dear, have medicine. Here. Here.
Sister!
Sister!
Omkar!
Omkar!
Why are you sitting in darkness?
What's the use of
sitting like this? Tell me.
She was not our kin.
She was very cruel.
She won our hearts and
then she left, dear.
Even if you banged your head,
still she won't come.
Have patience, dear. Have patience.
Have patience.
Chandan.
Light the lamp at home.
Make him feel better.
He does so much for you.
You too look after him.
Make him laugh. Take
him around the village.
Come on. Light the lamp. Come on.
Go! Light the lamp.
"Goddess like face
filled with mercy."
"My sister-in-law is
one in a million."
Listen! What's the use of
putting yourself through all this?
What else is left besides?
She didn't belong to us.
She left us. She was..
God took what belonged to Him.
We have nothing to
say in front of Him.
Joy and sorrow are a part of life.
We have to endure it.
We have to forget the past
and think of the future.
Dear, don't be so sad. No.
What to do, father?
- Dear! Dear!
Uncle! Are you going to the fields?
Yes, dear. We all have
to endure this calamity.
Tell me, Mrs. Thakur. Are you fine?
Gunja!
Eat it.
No. Today is Monday. I
eat just once. - Oh!
Any news of that place?
No.
What happened?
I am regretting, Phuleshwari!
Why did I prohibit him from
coming here? If he had come then..
Gunja..
Yes, father.
- Get my shawl!
Okay!
No! Gunja!
- She is coming!
Look after him! He
didn't even let me sit there!
He was just asking for you! Here!
He is my dear child!
You harass your grandma?
Naughty!
It's not good for Gunja
to get so attached to him.
There will be a problem later.
- Why?
Gunja too has to get married.
What then? Will she take him along?
Try to understand worldly matters!
He is Omkar's child.
Omkar will come and take him away.
But who will look after him?
If not now then later.. they
will have to manage the house.
This is what I am saying.
If the child won't
live in his house then..
..how will he know where his
house is.. and who his father is?
Moreover.. daughter-in-law had
looked after this house so lovingly.
We have to look
after the house as well.
Doctor, this house
needs a daughter-in-law.
Nobody listens to me but! - Dear..
Omkar! Besides looking
after the house and cooking..
..a man too has his needs.
What is your age?
How will you live?
Father, I will somehow manage.
As far as looking after
the house is concerned..
..why don't you get
Chandan married?
No! No, brother! I can't do this!
You get married. Bring Munna home.
Get your smile back. Then
I will do whatever you say.
No. I can't give more sorrow to
Munna by bringing a step-mother.
Are all step-mothers bad?
Even we are there
to look after Munna.
Why will he be sad?
Considering the
circumstances I have a suggestion.
Shall I tell you?
- Yes.
It's true that a step-mother is
a step-mother after all. - Yes.
So for Munna's wellbeing I feel..
..what's the harm if
Gunja comes in this house?
Gunja! Omkar!
Omkar! If you marry Gunja, all
the problems will be solved.
I have to get her married too.
Moreover.. Munna is
very attached to Gunja.
Gunja has lived in this house.
You all know her.
Munna won't even know that
Gunja is not his mother.
Tell me, Omkar. Pay heed to
what this old man has to say.
My problem will be solved.
Tell me, dear.
As you wish.
Chandan! What do you say?
Uncle, if brother is happy,
then I don't mind.
You have come.
- Yes.
I had gone to Balihar.
- What happened?
I spoke to Mr. Tiwari
about Gunja's marriage.
Is that so?
- Yes.
Father, shall I get water?
- Yes, dear.
Wait! First I want to wash my feet!
- Okay!
When is the marriage
that you have fixed like?
Engagement after 5 days!
Marriage after 7 days!
There is not much time.
We will make all the arrangements.
They said not to conduct
the marriage too grandly.
They are facing problem in cooking.
Where are you going?
- I will just come, mother!
Phuleshwari!
Uncle..
- You have come, dear?
Yes!
- Sit! - No, its okay!
I have called the
palanquin guy and the musical band.
Everything is fixed.
- Okay.
I have paid the advance. I
have bought the clothes.
I have got the cloth
for you for your shirt.
Go to the tailor
and get it stitched.
Why for me?
What do you mean?
Look! Give it to him now.
You will get it on time.
Go. Come on.
Okay. I am going. Come on!
He has decided. So, he won't budge.
Poor guy is working so hard.
He is handling all
the responsibilities..
..as if he is the eldest member.
Come on! Come!
Come on!
- Let's go!
Chandan!
What?
I have been searching
for you for past 2 days.
Why? What's the matter?
What is going on?
- What?
Don't pretend that
you don't understand.
What are you trying to say?
Remember what you told me that day?
What happened? Where is your love?
There is still time left.
Go and tell your brother.
Otherwise, you will
regret all your life.
Why are you doing this?
Why do you care? Why I am
doing this.. only I know that.
Then you don't know the pain
of love. Ask me. I know it.
We only want to see our love happy.
We only wish joys
for the one we love.
Even if you have to
suffer for yourself!
And you.. you deliberately
want to give her sorrow!
Was your love fake?
Were you playing with her?
Shut up, Rajjo!
No! I won't keep quiet! I
will go and tell everybody!
I will tell your uncle, my uncle,
and brother Omkar!
No, no! No, Rajjo!
You won't tell anybody!
You are under my oath!
Rajjo, if you have ever loved me..
..then for the sake of
that love, don't say anything.
I.. lied to you about Gunja.
It was not true.
What is going on.. that
is true. That is true.
She will forget us once she
goes to her in -law's place!
Forget it. She has
already forgotten us.
Come on! The wedding
procession has arrived! - Come on!
Come on! The wedding
procession has arrived!
Hurry up!
- Come on!
I too want to see!
We too will go and see
the wedding procession.
No. You go. I won't go.
Come! - No, you go!
C'mon!
Munna is alone here! You go!
Gunja!
- Yes!
Gunja!
- What?
Gunja!
Tell me! Chandan looks
good as a groom, doesn't he?
Gunja, Chandan is not the groom!
It's your brother-in-law!
- What!
Yes!
No! This can't be true!
You are joking, right?
No, Gunja! I am telling the truth!
No! This can't be true!
I will go and see!
Mother!
Gunja! What happened?
What happened, dear?
O my God! What has happened to her?
Dear, go and call her father! Come!
What happened?
Just see.. what has happened to her.
Gunja! Gunja!
Father.
- Yes, dear!
What have you done,
father! Give me poison.
I want to die.
But I can't marry, father. - What?
Stop this marriage, father.
What madness is this! Keep quiet!
Strangulate me!
Kill me! Kill me!
What happened?
When I fixed the alliance
you didn't say anything!?
What did I know? That I
have been cheated. - Cheated?
Uncle.. she thought you have
fixed her marriage with Chandan.
With Chandan?
Yes! She loves Chandan!
Even Chandan loves her!
Sister had promised
to get them married.
Rupa is dead, dear.
If Chandan wanted to marry Gunja..
..then even he was there when
the alliance was being fixed.
Why didn't he say anything?
What? He didn't say anything?
No.. he didn't utter a word.
No. This can't be true!
I am not lying, dear. Chandan
is outside. Shall I call him?
You can ask him yourself.
I am not your enemy,
dear. I am your father.
Your father's honor
lies in your hands, dear.
The wedding
procession has come, dear.
Father! - Dear..
A woman is very strong!
No matter how many
sorrows she has to face..
..she endures it all.
Dear!
"Till the seven nuptial
rounds get completed.."
"..the bride doesn't
belong to the bridegroom."
"The bride isn't
considered married till then."
"Till the seven nuptial
rounds get completed.."
"I'm gradually losing on all hopes."
"I get connected to new
relations one by one."
"Losing out on hope."
"Forming new ties with strangers."
"The clouds of joy
have turned into tears."
"Till the seven nuptial
rounds get completed.."
"The bride isn't
considered married till then."
Dear!
What happened, dear? O my God!
Come on!
Gunja.
Gunja.. look at me!
What to see and what to hear now!?
Listen to me once! Then you can
be angry with me all your life.
I no longer have the
right to be angry with you.
The right which I
considered as mine..
..you have snatched that from me!
But.. I don't understand one thing.
Why did you take
such revenge from me?
Tell me. You had
promised to marry me.
What relationship have you
come to form with me today!
Tell me. Why did you
do this with me? Why?
What do I tell you, Gunja? I..
I convinced my heart.
When I have to endure the sorrow..
..then why not in front of the
person who has given me the same?
But what to do? I
couldn't control myself and..
Gunja.
I trusted you, Chandan.
I thought if my love
is strong enough..
..I will surely marry you.
Gunja, love is not
everything in life.
There is something called duty too.
Gunja, you came
much later in my life.
Since childhood,
brother has been with me.
I don't even remember
my mother and father.
Brother raised me up.
My brother did everything for me.
After sister-in-law's death..
my brother..
..went through such
severe emotional pain.
I couldn't see him like that, Gunja!
I felt like.. what to do,
how to make him happy!
I was ready to sacrifice
everything for his happiness!
Gunja, it was not just about me.
It was about brother's happiness.
It was about that house which
sister-in-law adorned so lovingly.
It was about Munna.
So, I thought, only you
can look after that house.
I kept quiet. Gunja, I
trusted you so much..
..that if you hear my helplessness..
..then you will understand
me and you will forgive me.
You.. are very bighearted, Chandan.
Yes.
Earlier I just loved you but now..
..I will worship you.
So what if the
devotee doesn't find God?
He still continues to worship Him.
I will never break your trust,
Chandan. Never.
Gunja!
- I will do whatever you say!
No, Gunja!
Brother!
Fool! What were you both talking?
You people will forsake
your happiness for me and..
..I will be happy? What do
you think of me? Will I..
Brother!
Enough. Gunja! You don't worry!
Only he will be your husband!
I will go and talk to them!
Doctor.
- Yes.
Our happiness lies in
that of our children's.
Everybody's wellbeing lies in it.
Let Chandan marry Gunja now!
God bless you!
