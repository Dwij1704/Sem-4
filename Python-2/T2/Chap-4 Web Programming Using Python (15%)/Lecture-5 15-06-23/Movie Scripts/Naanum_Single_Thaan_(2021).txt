' I'm single too '
Uncle works here.
Dude, does he clean this
big building all by himself?
He is a famous RJ!
RJ is over there.
You can go and see him.
Nice to meet you.
That is him!
Love isn't something we go seeking.
It should happen by itself.






It should attack us...
turn us upside down,
and rattle us!
That is true love.
Greetings to the Tamil people in London.
I am your love.
Mr. Love.
You are listening to 99.9 Heart FM.
If you have any love problems,
I'll help you clear them.
Dude, if we get into his good books...
he will help us more
than what we hoped for.
They want to meet you.
He is here!
Just watch my performance now!
- Hey, you!
- Hi, Uncle.






I am Sriramakrishnan Govindanarayanan.
Gopalakrishnan Vishwantha
 Ramamoorthy's son.
How is your father doing?
He is doing really well!
So, you only told me you were coming.
Who are these people?
My friends.
- Oh, I see.
- Uncle, this is for you.
We are big fans of yours.
Yes, Uncle. I love your voice.
I never go to sleep at night
without hearing your voice.
I also wanted my voice
to sound like yours.
so I asked the doctor to perform
an operation, but he flatly refused!
You don't have to spend
all that money.
If you get a sore throat,
you will have my voice!
I really like your sense of humour, Uncle!
I never knew I had fans like you.
There are people in India
who are addicted to your voice.
The Statue of Unity in India
is the tallest statue.
We will erect a taller statue for you.
Sir, don't cry.
Do you love Love so much?
Yes.
I want to help you somehow.
Thank you, Uncle.
Let's eat and talk.
Let's go up and talk.
Love Uncle, how long
have you been in London?
I've been here for 20 years.
I got here with the money
your father gave me.
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.
His father doesn't give any money
to his own son!
How did he give Love any money?
He probably stole it!
That's a long story.
Let that be. Tell me
the purpose of your visit.
Uncle, it's a matter of love.
A matter of love,
or lust?
Will you help either way?
No lust.
Only...
love.
Your face said otherwise!
It is love! It's love!
It's love.
Love!
You don't have the face
of someone who is in love.
Oh no!
Not me, Uncle.
Oh, that guy?
No wonder he looks like someone
who lost his passport.
I have united so many couples.
I will surely help you.
Tell me your story.
Uncle, drinking so early
in the day?
Son, how would I be able to
tolerate your stories without this?
Why, Uncle?
I'm sure your love stories
are nothing new.
How could you say that, Love?
You might have heard many love stories...
but never anything like ours.
- Who are you people?
- Who are we?
Even if the world opposes us...
even if the world humiliates us...
even if the world spits on our faces...
we would ignore everything
and continue living in style.
We are the great '90s kids'.
The four of us aren't wastrels
like you might have thought.
- No?
- We are virgin boys.
Our gang leader is Uday.
He is the Head of Singles Union.
We never go and pick quarrels.
But when they come our way,
we pick them apart!
When we have a problem,
Uday comes to our rescue.
We have come to London
only for him.
Only we have the rights to harass
the couples in our hood.
How dare you mess with them?
Take your hands off her, you runt.
- You dared hit our guy?
- Dude, I was just talking!
Dude, beat them up!
What's happening?
A fight.
- I think they are fighting over you?
- Oh yes.
If not Trisha, then Divya!
Wait, I'll tell them.
Hi!
I...
love you.
Sorry, I'm already engaged.
Even Google has rejected our love.
After Uday tattooed a Nemo
for Trisha...
he wanted a girl like her.
But since he got
a Billa tattoo for Nayanthara...
he has wanted a girl like her.
Boss, it looks great.
I'm the one who tattooed
The Undertaker and The Rock!
This is nothing!
You are showing off
for such a lame tattoo?
Hit him!
- He should never open his mouth again.
- Guys, don't do it.
Uday runs a tattoo parlour...
what do you guys do?
Uncle, we work at Facebook.
- At Facebook?
- Yes, Uncle.
You must be big shots!
What do you at Facebook?
If we tell you,
you will slipper us!
I criticize movies and post reviews.
I criticize everything through memes.
I 'like' both their posts.
You call this a profession?
Yuck!
Come on, Uncle.
For engineers like us, social media
is the only source of bread and butter.
Yeah, right.
Fine, continue the story.
I've always wanted to buy
a mobile with fingerprint lock.
Don't buy those things.
They kill the birds!
- You've seen the movie 2.0, right?
- This guy...
What you say is right.
Where is your cellphone?
- In my pocket.
- Careful, your birds would die too!
So funny!
This is the latest model.
Fast moving.
You can buy it blindly.
You are trying to sell us
a duplicate.
None of the features work!
I've sold thousands of phones.
This has never happened.
- Show me your hand.
- Why?
- Just show me your hand.
- Show it, dude.
Are you single?
Proudly single!
Then how would the fingerprint work?
Maybe you can unlock it
with his footprint?
There is a feature called face-lock
specifically for singles like you.
- Try that.
- Buzz off.
- What if that doesn't work?
- Nothing will!
Bro, step aside.
Sir, I got this phone only yesterday.
The fingerprint doesn't work.
- Show me.
- To hell with your mobile.
- Are you single?
- Yes, bro.
- Then shut it and come with us.
- Join our Union!
Dude, everything was done last week.
I'll complain to your dad
if you don't stop peeping in!
I did it, dude!
What? Aren't you in 12th grade?
10th grade.
My friends think I'm already late,
and tease me for it!
Baby, combined studies?
I'm coming there.
Did you just hear what
that little punk said?
I swear...
if we stay single any longer...
They'd cancel our Aadhaar cards?
We have no other option
but to commit suicide.
Dude...
We are the '90s kids' who thought babies
are born when a man hugs a woman!
After we finished college...
compared to the people who humiliated us
by asking, 'Do you have a job?'
'Are you single'
'Are you still a virgin?'
More people have humiliated us
by asking those questions!
My father is a 60s kid.
Even he got committed!
You were born only because
your father got committed!
Dude, he doesn't even know the basics.
Why is he with us?
Dude, we will all be turning 30 soon.
Even if our parents
find us brides...
do you think they would
call us as 'dear'?
They will call us 'Uncle'.
Uncle?
We should find a hot chick like Nayanthara
and settle down before we hit 30!
Why are you laughing
like an idiot?
We can't even get a chick...
let alone a chick like Nayanthara!
You are so greedy.
He was just joking.
Ignore him.
You thought I was joking?
I am being serious here!
Virgin boys, single boys,
listen up everyone.
That would be just the 4 of us!
Before I turn 30...
I am going to find a girl like Nayanthara,
impress her, and get committed!
You are going to watch
this 90s kid's game!
Shwetha, take off that shawl.
You've got nice ones!
This is my first time.
I really didn't expect you
to agree to this so easily.
I didn't give in.
You talked and charmed me!
Okay, let's get started?
You go first.
Now it's your turn.
No, no, no.
Shwetha...
why did you stop?
I'm shy.
This is nothing to be shy about.
Just look at me.
Who are these girls?
You blackmail my friend
with her private photos?
Now, I have your video.
Don't, woman!
Don't mess with me.
Do you know who I am?
I see who you are!
Your video is going to trend
all over social media today!
Don't!
You don't know me.
You will really regret this later.
No, Shwetha.
We might get into trouble.
He did something wrong.
Why should you fear?
Today, one can't even
trust her own husband.
If you trust guys like him
and go to pubs and parties...
they will get your photos
and blackmail you.
Just don't trust guys, okay?
She sounds like a real terror!
When the scene started,
I'm sure you thought otherwise!
Yes!
I was wondering why you were telling an
adult story instead of a love story...
but the climax was bang on!
Terrific!
Dude, all the sites have been blocked.
We are so starved.
I knew this would happen someday,
so I've saved 1 TB since 8th grade!
Start!
You are a 'ghilli'.
Oh God!
You fool!
Come.
Why do I see two of everything!
Boys, come out to eat.
Buddy...
Are you coming out or not?
Oh no!
- What is going on?
- He has a stomach ache.
That's why he is screaming helplessly.
Oh no, Daddy!
Is it a stomach ache
or further below?
I know everything.
I've downloaded stuff too.
I've got 2 TB!
Shut it and come to eat now.
- I'm coming.
- Okay, Uncle.
- That was humiliating.
- What do we do now?
You horny beast!
He is trying to steal the 1 TB.
First I will...
Here is the rent for this month.
Superb, dude.
Sorry, dad!
- Thank you, dad.
- It's okay.
You wanted money to setup the shop.
Now you want us to pay the rent too?
When are you going to become a
breadwinner for the family?
He will give you
after he prints them!
You just need 10 bucks
for bread, right?
No big deal!
Here you go.
It's a crisp new note.
Enjoy!
I'll smack you!
Being cocky?
If I had known you'd be
hanging out with wastrels like these...
I would have you Wastrel Kumar
instead of Uday Kumar!
Superb! Looks like this name
might catch on.
You've started to talk well, Mom!
Give it, I'll serve my son.
- See this?
- You saw it!
What's up, dude?
Idlis are heart shaped?
Looks like you are in a romantic
mood already.
All the young men in our area
are married now.
No one wants to marry their daughters
to you when they hear about your jobs.
I was hoping he would fall in love
and bring some girl home...
but he is adamant that he wants
a girl like Nayanthara...
and is running around with
wild hair like Yogi Babu.
He is so naive
like 'Heart' Murali.
I was hoping these heart shaped idlis
would make him feel some shame.
How was that?
He'd have no shame even
if you feed him a heart!
You guys ruin him!
- Shut it and eat now.
- Be respectful like that!
I feel it.
- Why are you angry?
- I feel it now.
You feel it?
If you don't get married before 30,
you can only get married at 45.
That's what our astrologer said.
Remember that!
Ask him if he has a daughter!
You got married at
the age of 20.
You don't know the pain
of getting slippered by women.
I did get slippered by this chick
before I managed to woo her.
Quit talking and get to work.
You call your wife a chick?
Yeah, I can't call her a tramp
can I? You idiot!
Eat up!
You haven't served me anything!
Tell her it's from the boss.
What's your name?
I'm Uday the playboy.
Looks like you play
games on your phone.
You thought I am the sort of playboy
who wears headphones and plays PUBG?
I pick up girls and after it is done,
I change my number and the girl.
I am the original playboy!
How many times have
you changed your number?
Not even once.
- Hi.
- Hi, I am IAS.
- Indian Administrative Services?
- Oh no, you got it wrong!
I Am Single.
If you are okay with it,
ready to mingle.
Eww!
Hi, XL sized Trisha.
By the by, my name is Neelakantan.
People call be Blue Bell.
- I love you.
- Nice name, Uncle.
Uncle?
Dude...
They call me 'Uncle' even
before I near them.
Hi, I'm Sivaramakrishnan Govindanarayanan.
Will you marry me?
When I propose marriage,
they pepper spray me!
Uday...
your father is poking fun
at us for still being single.
It's been 2 weeks since
we challenged him.
We are still single.
We've been single for 29 years now.
Dude, I've got an idea.
I'm going to call all the chicks
on my phone book and impress them.
Show me.
Look at this...
Grocery Girl.
Vegetable Woman.
Milk Maid.
These are the chicks
on his phone book!
Look at his face!
All the girls in our area
know us too well.
We need to change locations.
Dude, let's hit the temple?
And sing devotional songs?
- Why don't we go to the bus stop.
- Girls don't take buses these days.
All of them use Olas and Ubers.
What else can we do?
- How about a pub?
- They don't allow stags.
Dance class?
What for?
That's where we can hug girls
and learn dance, like they show on TV.
"Aye.."
"Mic Check 1... 2..."
"It's the girl LK?"
"She is a desi lady, queen of the house;
A precious woman, worth a million"
"Got a reputation known around the nation;
Pull the trigger, getting off, at another station"
"Sizzling by...
Killin' the time"
"Like a criminal she be
killing 'em with kind smiles"
"She - she be feeling fine;
You - you be outta line"
"Dripping words like honey;
I know ya feeling the vibe"
- She looks so beautiful.
- Stop looking at her that way!
"Signing out..."
When he was a kid,
he made a mistake...
falling from the rooftop hoping
Shakthimaan would save him.
His next mistake was...
falling in love with this girl.
How does love at first sight happen?
Love happens at first sight.
What you feel after meeting often is lust.
Selva sir said that.
Not me.
Oh, I see.
Dude, congratulations.
Her status shows 'single'.
Yay!
Dude, congrats.
Why are you over the moon
because his chick is single?
It is so rare to find a girl
whose status is single.
Even married aunties display
their status as single these days!
Really?
Hey, I'm sorry.
Let's continue!
- This won't work out.
- Why?
Even average looking chicks
have 5000 friends.
But she only has 48 friends.
Part 1 would be just about
you becoming friends with her.
Love and marriage would
be Part 2, Part 3 etc.
- This isn't going out.
- But this will, come on!
How? Look at that.
She only has 4 solo photos.
- The rest are with boys?
- That would still be fine...
She has posed with kids and dogs.
I think she does social service.
You will see her
pose with me now!
I love your optimism.
This isn't going to work out.
She will be here, right?
Dude, her friend put up an Instagram post
an hour ago that they'd be here.
They will surely come.
Only committed women come here.
How can we impress them?
Those are the only women
who would fall for you.
There is a trick to impress such girls.
What trick?
We aren't going to
impress ordinary girls.
Then what? Cheer girls?
We are going to impress..
foodie girls.
- What does that mean?
- You know...
the kind of girls who would
travel across the town for free chow!
Exactly!
When we spend our parents' money
for food, we are called free-loaders.
But when they do it,
they are called foodies.
Dude, so free-loader
means foodie?
Exactly!
Dude, your chick is here.
There are 4 of them,
and 4 of us.
Shall we impress those girls,
like they do in the movies?
What if we slip a fish
in their blouse, like in Veera?
What if they take us
to the police station?
Come on!
What if we let them walk
on our hands, like in Suryavamsam?
Did you see their heels?
If they step on our hands...
we will have a penny sized
hole in our hands.
My Nayanthara is here!
She eats a slice of pizza
and slices my heart into pieces.
I also write the poetry
I am going to buy white kurta
Hi!
What is your name?
Prabhu.
Very nice name.
Are you hungry?
Yes.
- Let's eat some pizza?
- Okay.
Come.
He is very cute, no?
- Is it good?
- Yes.
- Is that enough?
- Yes.
Good.
Wait!
One more...
Happy?
You can guess what happened next.
He did exactly what every hero
in one side love stories do.
That is why we are skipping
to the next interesting scene.
Look at the girl who is lying on
our beach like it's some vacation resort...
you need to tattoo her.
Normally foreigners like getting
tattooed in really odd places.
She will get the tattoo from you,
and I will get...
I meant I'll get
the money from her!
Dude, but you need to pay
me my commission.
[singing love song]
Hi, darling.
What? Darling?
She doesn't have a problem,
what's yours?
My oldest friend.
Hi!
Hi!
I'm Uday.
Manza.
He is the tattoo artist.
Best in town.
Take your towel off
and he'd do it.
Stop asking questions all the time.
Hang up now!
Who was that?
Your boyfriend?
Yeah. I am not as happy as I was,
since I got committed.
See!
Atleast now, understand that
single life is happy life.
If we let men get anywhere near us,
they will ruin our lives.
So, why do you really hate men?
Maybe you are...
- I'll smack you!
- Sorry!
What, then?
Can't women live without men?
We can!
Then what?
We only have one life.
We should live it the way
we want to, and be happy.
Yes, when a husband or boyfriend
enters our lives...
they would place
too many restrictions on us...
and tell us to live the way
they think we should.
But they don't really care
about what we think.
Not all men are like that.
There are good men, too.
We need to have some trust.
Why don't you trust anyone?
Let me ask a simple question.
Is there any guarantee that the man
you marry will be with you your whole life?
Then why would you agree
to marry him?
No love.
No relationship.
No marriage.
No tension.
Oh, so a boy who wants
to get committed...
and a girl who wants to remain single.
Seems like a complicated story.
With a head like that,
it will seem that way!
Uncle, have you been in love with anyone?
Son, I was...
deeply in love with a woman.
But she died.
No wonder she died!
Since her death,
I started helping other lovers.
Who is that woman?
Diana.
No wonder she died!
Sorry, Uncle.
Was I too loud?
Let us continue the story.
So, what kind of tattoo
do you like, Manza?
I already have my design.
- Oh, you have?
- Yeah.
Now it's easy.
- Look, this...
- Get her Instagram ID.
Dude, it is Thala's photo.
Even Hollywood women
like our Thala.
Talk to her in English and ask her
where she wants the tattoo?
Check this out.
On your body,
where draw?
Dude, you've got her thinking!
- Here.
- Oh, God!
No, no.
We always hold our Thala
close to our hearts.
So, we will only
tattoo your chest.
You might be a Thala fan.
But I'm a Thalapathy fan.
We hold Thalapathy
close to our hearts too.
Why are we fighting now?
Dude, you draw Thala on one side,
and Thalapathy on the other.
If you do that...
not just their fans,
all the fans will be so happy.
My job is to make everyone happy.
Hi, guys.
Dude, who is he?
Looks like a mixture of Hindi and English.
You tattoo me first,
and then my girlfriend.
Dude...
I think you can tattoo her
only if you tattoo him first.
This is just like those
statutory smoking warning.
Deal with him first,
then we can watch it all.
Who got this customer?
- Him!
- It was me.
- Hold this a second.
- He is good.
You do the tattoo.
- Dude, wait.
- Don't go!
Thought you were a professional!
You get to tattoo the women,
but I need to do the men?
Ask him what tattoo he wants.
What tattoo you want?
Snake.
He wants a snake.
Ask him where he wants it.
Where do you want?
Here!
Why did he strip?
You take care of this customer
I am leaving
- Dude, wait!
- Thank God! He was wearing underwear
A tatoo?
On your thigh?
Dude, he stripped everything.
I escaped just in the nick of time.
He was stripping everyting!
If I had done the tattoo...
he would have been dead!
Wait...
- That is Shwetha.
- Yes.
Dude, normally its the men
who go after the women...
how come they are
doing it today?
I told you, didn't I?
There are love waves connecting us.
Believe me now?
What are you waiting for?
Get her!
Yes, let's do that.
Who are you people?
- Let us go.
- Looks like a problem!
Let go!
Stop!
Darling, my video didn't trend
like you said it would.
How many views?
42k, boss.
Just 42k!
So sad, right?
I expected atleast 50k.
I'll make sure your video...
gets 1 million views.
That is my target, woman.
Start camera.
Rolling, sir.
This would only get 100k views.
I need a million views!
Brother, this isn't how
you treat a girl!
Girls need to be...
treated gently, like a flower.
Who are you?
Me?
The name is Uday. 29 years old.
I want to get married before I turn 30.
- I run a tattoo shop, I'm a 90s kid...
- Stop!
Do you want any more details?
What is she to you?
I mean nothing to her.
But she means a lot to me.
Is it love?
Let me find out.
Yeah?
So it's not love?
Guys behave themselves
only till they get a chance.
He got a great chance last night...
wonder what all he did to you!
She got drenched in the rain.
And she got hurt too.
Maybe that's why he
changed her clothes.
What's wrong with that?
Whatever the circumstances, why would anyone
change the clothes of an unconscious girl?
Don't think everyone
acts like your boyfriend.
He took a big risk for her.
That doesn't mean
he is a good guy.
- Then what?
- I'll put him to the test.
If he passes the test,
we can trust him.
Why are you tensed now?
I thought I'd watch a bit of smut
to relieve the tension...
but I'm tensed because
I don't know what to watch!
Why don't we watch
a bit of everything?
That's a great idea!
Hurry up, let's watch something.
That one...
Why are they here?
- Hi!
- Hi...
I want a tattoo.
Sure!
Dudes, show our catalogues
to the catwalkers.
- Right away!
- Wait...
- They are customers!
- Just wanted to help you.
I already have a design in mind.
I'm a huge fan of Shruti Hassan.
Have you seen the tattoo on
her shoulder with her name?
I want a similar one
with my name.
You look like the voodoo doll
from the movie Annabelle...
and you're a Shruti Hassan fan?
We should get started or he will
impress all the chicks.
- Damn, didn't know it was this heavy.
- Time for me to get started.
Sit on this barrel.
You look like one yourself!
Here, have a look.
Hi, I'm SI.
SI?
I mean, I am single.
Spell your name.
S-U-
N-N-Y
Sunny.
Nice name.
That one?
That girl?
No, the one in pink dress.
That isn't a dress.
It's a body tattoo!
By the by,
whose fan are you?
I'm a fan of Trisha.
- Whose fan are you?
- I'm Khushboo's fan.
Then tattoo yourself!
A fan of Trisha?
Do you know where Trisha
has a tattoo?
I know.
She only has a small fish.
Come with me,
I'll give you a whale.
- No need.
- I can do a whale too.
You'd even do a whale!
You horny beast!
I'm second in command
after Uday here.
So talk to me.
Show me, I'll do it!
- Stupid!
- Are you going to hit me?
Go ahead! Atleast that way
you'd touch me.
So much fun annoying her!
Let's leave, girls.
Dude, we are having a lot of fun.
Come here.
- Wait, don't get angry.
- We do great tattoos!
I'll atleast do an
anchovy for free!
What's up?
I said I'll do it
but they just left.
Dude, they were our first
customers in six months!
They didn't look like they
came here to get tattoos.
They look like ones who steal
hair clips at a fancy store!
They won't get tattoos!
Once I pick up the needle,
I have to tattoo someone!
Whose phone is this?
Hello?
This is Sunny speaking.
When I came to get
a tattoo earlier today...
I forgot my phone.
You can collect it
from the shop.
There is no one else at home.
No one at home?
Can you come here
and drop it off, please?
Share your location on WhatsApp.
I'll be there.
Do you know about
one night stand?
One night stand?
You wretch!
- What are you doing?
- Just wait and see...
He will look it up on Google,
and show up here with a wide grin.
One night stand!
Apparently a man and a woman
get into a relationship for just one night.
They can do anything they want
on that night.
Next day, they go their
own respective ways.
This sounds great!
Wait, where are you going?
Hi, Sunny.
Uday?
Sunny had asked me
to drop off her phone.
I'm Sunny... the one who
spoke to you?
- Oh, that's you?
- There is no one at home.
So...
shall we go?
What?
Shall we go to my bedroom?
Sorry.
Why?
You don't like me?
If you'd called me some days back,
I'd have definitely come in.
But now I'm sincerely
in love with a woman.
So sorry.
Please give this to Sunny.
Bye!
When I wasn't in love,
these chances never arose...
but now I'm in love,
and I get these chances!
Why God why?
What happened?
Don't over think this.
He seems to be a good person.
I'm guessing he turned you down?
He is just a kid!
Forget a one night stand...
Just say the word...
I'll be standing every night.
Standing outside her house?
He isn't up for the job.
He is a 90s kid.
- What about you?
- I was born in 91!
One night stand, right?
I can stay up and work hard.
I'm ready.
I'm not greedy like them.
I don't need a night.
One minute is enough.
- Is that how long you last?
- I am ready.
I'm not ready.
After that test, the very girl
who said she hated guys...
became friends with Uday.
Uday hid his feelings
and looked at her as a friend.
What else could he do?
You know how boys are!
That's when that
shocking incident happened.
I'll tell you the occasion
for dinner later.
Okay?
8 pm.
Done!
Bye.
You have invited him for dinner?
But you don't like men at all.
What about your rules?
Uday is a good person.
Unlike other men, who ask you out
on dates once you get friendly...
he is just being
a good friend.
Oh wow!
This is the first time you are
certifying a guy's character!
Surprising!
This is the first time
I met a genuine guy.
He is a good man.
I believe he will always be one.
Do you like him?
I like him as a friend.
Only!
At this point of time,
I want to achieve in my career.
Darn guy, he doesn't have
any perfume.
He's only got empty bottles!
I've opened your new perfume.
Why is he taking so long?
Uday, are you coming out?
What are you doing?
You never use your bathroom.
Atleast let him use it!
There he comes.
Why is he walking backwards?
What is this?
How is it so huge?
Who were your ancestors?
Shut up! It became like this
after I sprayed perfume.
Which perfume?
The one hidden down
under your cupboard.
So you'd just spray it down under?
You fool! That's my father's Viagra spray.
Viagra? I thought it was perfume.
People generally spray perfume
on their shirt. Why did you...
spray it down there?
I made a mistake.
Give me some idea now.
Dude, it is effective for 2 hours.
Careful when you ride your bike.
Dude, I can't even zip my pants.
Shwetha is waiting for me.
Take off your towel.
Just to get an idea!
You get ideas only
if he takes his towel off?
You need to go
see your chick, don't you?
Absolutely!
Then take it off.
'Warning:Children, elderly and the
weak hearted should close their eyes.'
Yes! Yes!
Yes?
You two should take yours off now.
You asked him to strip first,
and now you want us to do the same?
You want to
take a look at all of us?
Don't tire me!
I meant, take your belts off.
I'm only wearing a waist thread.
Dude, you take your belt off.
Let's take our belts off
and use that spray too.
- Give that to me.
- It's a new belt.
We will see
who wins today...
Big brother vs little brother.
He is just diving in!
Deadpool, you are alive.
Uday...
2.0
I need to go.
Bye!
- He is leaving.
- Dude, stop!
Uday, hold on a second.
You forgot the most important weapon.
- What is this for?
- So that you can touch her.
Kiss her on pretext of tattoo
What are you pondering over?
Unlike what you think,
women don't say it blatantly.
They throw hints by inviting you
for lunch, dinner, supper etc.
We need to get the hint.
Get it?
Winner winner, chicken dinner.
- It's about time.
- Take care, dude.
Dude, don't miss the chance
Enjoy
Why did you step on my toes?
- Let's try out that spray.
- Let's go!
Hi!
Hi! Come in.
What's with the sudden dinner?
The setup looks great, too.
- What for?
- It's a surprise.
- Surprise?
- I'll tell you.
Wait for 2 minutes.
I'll call you when
it is ready, okay?
Okay.
Dinner in two minutes?
It has to be instant noodles!
This darn spray.
You've got clothes lying around,
like a bachelor house!
Head of Singles Union...
if she has left it lying around,
she is hinting at it.
Make an attempt!
This is her house.
She might leave her clothes lying around.
I shouldn't look at it!
But you are looking!
The spray is starting
 to take full effect.
Control!
Uday, ready.
Yes!
Uday...
Chicken!
Mutton!
This is superb.
It is so hot.
Yes, quite hot indeed.
How about you?
You drink.
This is superb.
Did you cook it?
Yes.
Whoever marries you
is one lucky man.
Dude, what is more important
to you? Chicken or the chick?
Chicken or the chick?
Chicken, of course.
Pass me that leg piece.
She is only changing clothes
in her own house.
I shouldn't look.
Don't look!
- How was the food?
- Don't ponder, pounce on her!
Uday?
How was the food?
I told you, it was superb.
The food was great.
- Why did you--
- One second.
You never told me
what's the occasion for dinner.
Wait, I'll tell you.
Wait?
If I stay here any longer,
it is danger!
That tattoo looks good.
This isn't a tattoo.
It's my birth mark.
Birth mark?
Don't lie.
Can birthmarks look like this?
I'm not lying, Shwetha.
I've tattooed several people...
but I was tattooed
by the Lord.
I've had no love in my life,
but he drew a heart on my hand!
God must be crazy, you know!
Can you make a tattoo on me?
Where have all you guys gone?
- Say something!
- Uday...
Sure!
Every tattoo has a meaning.
Similarly...
where you choose to get it...
has a meaning too.
Oh!
Is that so?
Oh, yes. Tattoo on the hand
means a strong person.
Thigh means a trendy person.
Ankle means a mysterious person.
Chest means love.
My favourite is the back.
Why?
Because it's easy to tattoo
a large area.
I was joking!
Back tattoos are more private because
people generally don't see them, right?
Where do you want your tattoo?
You know me well.
Take a guess.
Your hand?
Because you are a strong woman.
Wow...
it's nice!
Very nice tattoo.
- Son...
- Don't get excited!
What you think didn't happen.
She swore at him so bad,
it got censored out!
Dude, I made a big mistake.
Listen to me carefully.
Don't go near her house
for the next 4 to 5 days.
She might file a case
out of anger.
Dude, what he says is right.
Think and make a decision.
All thanks to your father!
See what has happened because he
left the spray in your bathroom.
We should be a little patient.
I couldn't reach Shwetha's mobile phone.
- She left for the UK.
- What is UK?
London.
- When will she back?
- Maybe 2 to 3 years.
Bye.
Dude...
Why are you sad now?
There are other girls.
We are playboys!
You should have found
another girl by now!
Shut up, Four Eyes!
We are talking, right?
She left the town
because of me.
She must be suffering alone.
Shall I go to London too?
London?
Dude, you are 100 percent right.
In a way, we are responsible
for this mess too.
I'm the only one responsible.
Fine, but this isn't a Gautham Menon movie.
Going abroad isn't easy!
Yeah, you take care of the shop.
The three of us will go.
I want to come too!
We need to arrange money.
We need a plan.
Guys, going to London
isn't complicated.
What are you blabbering?
Two way tickets
cost 50,000 per head.
All of us can go
if we have 2 lakhs.
I just borrowed money
to open this shop.
- How much did you borrow?
- Two lakhs, dude.
Two lakhs?
Two lakhs!
We are going to London!
- To arrange for the tickets...
- I'll be back.
Where is he going?
It's just that...
he set-up this shop with his
father's hard earned money...
so he wants to look at it
one last time.
- He is a good guy.
- He is.
What is he holding?
We have money only for 4 tickets,
why are you taking her along?
Looks like he is leaving
one of us behind.
Dude, wait for me!
This is how we came to London, Love.
Uncle, you need to
unite him with his love.
Son...
Even if James Bond
comes against us...
I will unite you
with your love.
Singles...
take a leak
and be back soon.
You are going to watch
the real game now.
Wow, what a beautiful city!
Very nice.
- Look here.
- What are you looking at?
Dude, everything looks
bigger through this.
I know what you
are looking at...
put it away, you pervert!
I meant the building.
So, he is still the pervert then!
His father is calling.
Put the phone away.
Dude, use this phone.
That one is out of battery.
Superb!
Uncle is here.
- LKB...
- Son.
The company the girl works at
has 12 branches in London.
Looks like before you can locate her,
your visas will expire!
This isn't hard!
If we split up and search,
we will locate her in 4 days!
- This isn't new to us.
- Yeah, simple!
How do you hang out
with such guys?
Uncle, they need to
see each other.
Talk to each other.
And get together.
Move away!
You think you are Mani Ratnam?
Uncle, we'd do anything
for his love.
Oh?
Then go and look for her.
Give us some money then!

With the colour of your cheeks"

Shwetha!
Here!
So... new job, new boss...
how is it?
New job...
yes!
New boss...
okay!
Does he torture you?
A little.
What happened?
I got a message
requesting for blood donation.
So... hey, what are you thinking about?
My blood group is AB-
Okay...
And, it's a rare blood group.
- Fine!
- I think I should donate.
Okay, my time is up.
I should go.
- You go ahead, okay?
- Okay.
See you soon!
You have a really good heart.
- Thanks!
- Bye.
Bye.
Uday?
You should thank her.
She is the one who donated
her blood at the right time.
Thanks a lot, Shwetha.
He lost a lot of blood
as his blood vessels were cut.
It is sutured now...
and, because of your timely blood,
you have saved him.
Thank God!
But we need to keep
him in observation...
to rule out the head injury
as he fell down on his head.
Only one person
is allowed to be here.
Others, please leave.
Sure.
What are you doing here?
He came here to see you.
And look what happened!
The doctor says he will be okay...
that's enough for us!
He came here saying...
"I did something wrong,
so I have to see her."
He never took anything
in his life seriously.
The only thing he was
serious about was you.
My friend loves his parents.
He would do anything for them.
But he left his parents...
and came to this strange country
where he didn't know anyone or anything.
What do you think is the reason?
His love for you.
Please understand his love.
What would you have done
if something serious had happened to him?
Did you even think about his family?
We are his friends.
We would give our lives for him.
Listen...
take him home safely.
Please!
And if you need anything,
please take my number.
Take care.
Dude! Uday is okay.
Come in and see him.
I'm not coming.
Go away!
He is better now.
Why are you crying?
I swear, he is okay now.
Dude, just come in and look
at him once.
As a kid, I used to...
You meatball!
He is fine now,
and she looks real fine.
Can't I look at her?
Hey! Can't I look you?
"Tell your proposal before this song endl"
"Many songs in appear in screening
it will be trouble is to so?"
What's he doing?
He is going to propose.
What is the punishment
for eve teasing in this country?
They'll make sure you
can't do anything anymore!
Hi, Shwetha.
The girl is here!
I came to apologize to you,
but now I need to thank you.
Thank you.
The boys told me you donated your
blood at the right time and saved me.
Listen, Uday...
...that was an accident.
I donated my blood
to you by accident.
You didn't know
it was for me?
There are love waves connecting us.
That's why this happened.
Do you watch too many movies?
You thought if you follow me to
another country and say these dialogues...
I'll fall in love?
You won't?
GVM...
I watched your movies for nothing?
Would anyone come like this
to see a girl?
I'd come for you, Shwetha.
What if something had
happened to you?
Did you even think about your parents?
You are a good hearted woman.
I'd do anything to give them
a good daughter-in-law like you!
I really trusted you.
But you broke my trust.
Then you should have just gone.
I'd have been gone too.
Why did you save me?
I gave you a treat that day
because I was leaving for London.
But what did you do?
This won't work for me, Uday.
Shwetha, I'm not just fooling around.
I'm serious about you.
I want you to be with me all the time.
We should be happily married like my parents.
Those are your feelings.
And I'm not saying it's wrong.
But why aren't you trying
to understand my feelings?
I'm not interested in love or marriage.
The only thing important
to me is my career.
Do you know how hard I worked
to get here?
I'm soon going to
be a Project Leader.
This is my dream!
My dream, my love, my life...
everything is you, Shwetha.
I thought you would
be a good friend.
But you behaved like
an average man would.
What would make you
like me?
I like you.
But I don't like love.
So you won't like me
if I say I love you?
Friends?
She doesn't like love, Love.
Me?
I meant this love.
Love, is there anyone
who doesn't like love?
Is she being difficult?
She only said she doesn't like love.
She never said she doesn't like you!
Then what's the problem?
Make an attempt.
Dude, this is just a small problem.
Don't make a face like
you failed your 12th grades.
Failure is the...
what is it?
Doesn't matter if you
get the proverb wrong when drunk.
You are right!
These women who talk feminism
are actually weak on the inside.
But they just pretend
to be really tough people!
Don't fret over it,
she will come around.
Dude, I'm not saying this because
you got me London booze...
she really likes you.
But she isn't accepting your love
because she wants to play it cool.
You need to bring that love
out of her!
You 90s kids...
when will you get committed?
It's not like
we are saying no.
They are saying 'no'to us!
90s kids are the ones who
only depend on their own hands.
We will get committed soon!
Uday, I say this out of
my personal experience...
I know how hard it is
to live alone.
I have money.
I have all the comforts.
But I have no life.
That's why I help lovers like you.
But Uday, that girl is your life!
Don't give up!
- Come on, boys.
- Looks superb!
- How is my home?
- Looks superb!
- This is your house?
- Yes.
It is all shiny, like your head.
Funny guy.
Who is this really old man
posing in this photo?
I am Love Guru,
but he is my guru.
Touch and pray to him.
- Playboy guru.
- Can I touch her?
Enjoy yourself!
God, I want to be born
as his son in my next birth.
You'd still do nothing!
Sir, if this is your house,
what about the other one?
- That is mine, too.
- What are you saying?
Are you doing some smuggling
business in London?
Son, you don't know
how influential I am in London.
You will get to know eventually!
Did you buy this big house
by working in the radio station?
You shouldn't ask me.
It's illegal.
- I'll take a selfie with him.
- Enjoy!
Do those girls come here?
Wait and see.
Feelings, huh?
Uday...
the most difficult thing on earth
is securing a place in a girl's heart.
You need to work hard for it!
Come, I have a surprise for you.
Come on!
What, Love?
Wait and watch.
Love, this is superb!
- You are the best!
- Don't drop me!
Don't kill him
He is only one for our support
Thank you.
Love you!
Dai! What happend?
Yes!
This is the right sweater
for this cold!
You haven't just showed him the way.
You thought about us, too!
You are truly
a love guru.
This is a surprise for me too!
She looks like a delicious sweet.
Careful, the syrup might ooze out.
Wow, this is great!
I call dibs on that milkshake!
Do you know Uday has moved in
to the house across the hall?
So what?
We are just friends now.
You are friends?
You two are still friends
after everything that happened?
How?
Yes we can.
He told me!
Maybe he told you.
But still...
Do you think he will let you go?
Do you think he will just
leave after you become friends?
I'm telling you, he isn't going to
leave without you.
Let's see?
Okay, let's see.
Okay!
- Hi!
- Hi.
Hello.
This is Uday.
My friend.
You ordered it?
Thank you!
Hi, Mia!
I am Sivaramakrishnan
Govindanarayanan.
I come from a very orthodox family.
My dear Mia...
try me, we'd make a great pair.
In your heart,
I'll secure a place.
In my town,
I'll build you a palace.
After we marry,
I'll show you...
how much I care.
My dear Mia...
If God granted me one wish...
I'd only ask him for one thing.
Please turn me into a cat.
Because, the only word that
would come out of my mouth would be...
Mia! Mia!
Wow!
This is superb.
Dude, I need to pick up
some chick before we leave.
I only want Mia.
- Mia?
- I need to impress her!
- Is he thinking the same thing?
- She is mine!
- Let's see.
- Wait for me.
Yes?
Here I come.
Hi!
Hi.
- Hi!
- Hi.
Hi!
I'm Tamil, too.
Oh?
Superb!
Superb, superb.
Superb! Superb! Superb!
Come in.
Thank you, guys.
I heard you live across the hall...
you speak Tamil too.
So I brought a box of sweets
to start a friendship.
- I don't want to be friends!
- Just take it, dude.
Okay!
See you guys.
Bye, guys.
Bye, guys.
I'll see you.
Turn around and leave.
I'll see you!
She looks like melted butter!
Oh Mia...
Bye!
Cheers!
Dude, there are 4 of them.
One for each, but two for me. Okay?
Dude, three of them look hot.
But one of them
is all covered and quiet!
What are you hiding from us?
Son, sit!
- Sorry, Guru.
- Forgive us!
You kept your word and got all
those girls from the photo?
I only do what I say.
And say what I do.
Just tell us what to do,
we'd do it ourselves.
- I'll tell you.
- Yes, sir...
Every morsel of food you eat
after satiating your hunger...
belongs to someone else.
- Guru, I have a doubt.
- Ask me.
Guru, what should we do
for girls to like us?
Every girl likes something different.
If we do the things they like
the way they like it...
they will like us!
Talk without touching them.
We are feeling bitter!
If you can, use your talents
and impress the girls.
I'll go meet Uday.
Bye.
What do you like?
I like dance!
Oh darn!
What do you like basically?
I like acting.
Yeah?
I'm a professional actor.
I will perform.
She isn't interested in love.
She only wants to be friends.
Uday, when you confess
your love to girls...
...they'd initially turn you down.
Meanwhile, they would test the boy.
The one who passes the test
gets the girl.
How do I pass the test?
You need to wait.
You need to wait?
- Come, that's enough.
- Let me finish!
- You are jealous of me.
- Buddy, it's your turn.
- I don't have any talent!
- Why are you crying?
Which girl would like
boys like me?
I'm scared of hitting on women.
It will happen only if
they make the first move!
Don't cry, dude
Why is he crying?
He has cancer.
It was confirmed last night.
Dude, I told her.
Hello?
Hi, sir.
Yeah.
Okay...
Okay... yeah, that's the pass-code.
Got it. Thank you.
Come on, babe.
Don't stress out.
It's going to be fine.
Relax!
You have no idea!
I have to get this done
by the end of the day.
The tattoo looks great.
Where did you get it?
What do you care?
It was Uday, right?
So what?
I've been wanting to get
a tattoo for a while now.
That's why I asked!
Where should I get it?
On my hands?
Thighs?
Hips?
On my chest?
I'm confused.
I'll ask him!
Don't get a tattoo from him!
- Why?
- He isn't good.
Your tattoo looks good.
Mia, listen to me.
He is a little weird.
Oh, is he naughty?
I like naughty boys.
It's okay!
Hi, Uday.
How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?
- I'm okay. Fine!
You live with Shwetha, right?
You could tell her good things about me!
Forget Shwetha.
You tell me about yourself.
Half the film is done,
and you want me to start over?
I'm in London to fulfil my challenge
of falling in love and getting married.
I'm a true 90s kid!
Oh okay. 90s kid, huh?
Hey, nice arms.
You should leave now.
Leave?
Uday, just like the tattoo
you did on Shwetha's hand...
do a tattoo on me,
and I'd leave.
No way. Leave now.
You tattooed her hand,
where are you going to tattoo me?
On my legs?
Chest?
Hip?
I'm not leaving
unless you tattoo me.
I'm a lover boy, not a playboy.
Listen to me, leave.
Is that so?
Look here, Uday...
If you don't tattoo me now...
I'll tell the police
you molested me.
Police?
I've reported several people
to the police.
Think about it.
The decision is yours.
At home, I'd get away
with 100 rupees.
These people will ask
for a 100 pounds!
Mia, you got a package from Amazon.
I'm doing something amazing now!
Hang up now!
I'm sure he didn't tattoo you.
How is it?
Don't miss out on a single video.
We will use this to show off at home!
Shwetha isn't answering my calls.
Try again!
I said try to reach her,
but you are taking selfies?
- Sorry, dude.
- I'll try calling Mia.
Hello, Shwetha.
Hi, sir.
- How is it with the project?
- Everything is good.
- So far so good?
- Yes, sir.
- There are no problems?
- No.
That's great.
Here is the device.
Update the project.
Keep it with you carefully.
At 10 am, we need to log in.
- Alright.
- I will join you guys shortly.
- Okay, great.
- Thank you.
- Update the project. Don't forget!
- Yes. Thank you, sir.
Okay?
Listen Uday... Shwetha is
super busy today.
- Superb!
- Busy, right?
Yes, right.
- She has a project bid at 10 am.
- Wait for me!
It's very important.
I can't assure you that
she will come out.
But just wait, okay?
I'll try my best.
Okay.
Thank you, sir.
We only have a few days
left before our visas expire.
You need to impress
her before that.
Or the whole London trip
would go to a waste.
I'm talking to you!
Where are you going?
I'll be back.
Yes, sir.
Great! Okay, bye.
What happened?
Don't stress out.
Come on, let's go out for coffee.
No need!
I only have half an hour to login.
Come on, it only takes 5 minutes.
Let's go!
Please, let's go!
- Come, come, come.
- Okay!
We are going to get the project.
Don't stress yourself, okay?
What do you want?
Dude, the girls are here.
Where did he go?
We are trapped here!
What do we do now?
All of you hide your faces.
Hide it properly!
Hi, Shwetha!
Uday?
- What are you doing here?
- Came here to see you.
Uday, there is a limit for everything.
Don't disturb me
at my work place.
I need to meet my friends often.
That's why I came to
give you this bouquet...
...and wish you.
Do you know how
important today is?
Come!
I came for wish only
not proposal
She is tensed
because of her project.
Try to understand her, Uday.
See you.
Shwetha, where did you go?
I was just submitting
the final report, sir.
It's okay.
Just put the device.
We have 10 minutes only.
Yes, sir.
Shwetha, what happened?
Where is the device?
- You have the device, right?
- Yes, sir.
Maybe I left it in my cabin.
Can I go check?
Go, quick!
Dude, she rejected you and threw
the flowers away. Let's leave.
I'll tell her I'm leaving.
She threw those flowers
because she wanted you to leave.
Shwetha, where is the device?
We have 2 minute to login.
Sir, it is missing.
What do you mean it's missing?
We can't bid the project without the device.
I know sir...
but I can't find it, sir.
What do you mean it's missing?
I don't know, sir.
I can't find it.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm so sorry.
You idiot!
Please mind your words, sir.
How dare you raise your
voice against me?
Get out of my office.
Oh shit!
Uday, what are you doing here?
- Uday, leave this place.
- Who are you, man?
Uday, this is my problem.
- I'll solve this, please leave.
- He is going overboard.
I'm here for you!
Don't interfere in this.
This is my problem.
Get out of here.
Shwetha, don't hate Uday.
He is a poor guy.
I lost my job, Mia.
Do you understand that?
I lost my job.
He ruined my career.
What did he do?
You lost the login device!
The device must have fallen out of
my purse when I threw away his flowers
You don't get it.
He cares about you and loves you
more than you love yourself.
Shwetha, one second.
Look here.
- Please, Shwetha. Look here.
- What?
Look.
See...
He tattooed 'sister' on me.
It doesn't matter.
Okay, look! His friends
told me...
you'd understand him
if we make you feel possessive.
That is why we did this.
Please try to understand, Shwetha.
You won't find a better guy.
I know that he will definitely
take good care of you.
I don't care.
Bye, Mia.
Shwetha, you are fooling yourself.
That's okay.
Bye!
I treated you like my own sons.
He didn't tell us,
but atleast you could have!
My son must have suffered
a lot in London.
- It was just--
- Don't say anything!
He didn't go to the next town.
He crossed the seas
and went to London!
The astrologer said water
is dangerous to him!
He meant something else!
No wonder he met with an accident.
If something worse had happened,
who would have taken responsibility?
I should fall at his feet!
She seems furious.
How about you?
Cool!
Then let's have a couple of beers?
If you call all the shots,
what are we here for?
Why don't you arrange his wedding too?
Right from our school days,
to getting jobs...
you two have helped
us with everything.
So we thought we could atleast try to
help him with finding the bride...
but it didn't work
so we came back.
You were the one who urged him
to get married before 30.
So he stopped hanging out with us,
and started hanging out with that girl.
Now you are blaming us!
Why are you putting the
ball in my court?
Don't play the blame game now!
Just talk it out
and fix his marriage.
Like every other parent,
I wish to get my son married too.
I don't think it's beneath my prestige
to talk to the girl.
But what do you
guys do these days?
You fall in love through Facebook,
and break up over WhatsApp.
How can I take your word
and go to see her?
Girls these days place demands like...
"I want a helicopter."
"I want an aeroplane."
"I want a groom with
a monthly salary of 5 lakhs!"
We don't know about this girl.
Oh no, she is a nice girl.
But because we approached her...
My son is in love with a girl,
and you approached her?
No, he meant he approached
her friends.
- Speak clearly!
- Yes...
If you two talk to her, she will
understand Uday's love is serious...
and agree to marry him.
Yeah, right!
You will get him married anyway.
He will leave us.
We are going to be alone now.
You are my sons too.
After he gets engaged,
we will start bride hunting
for you the very next week, okay?
So let's get Uday married next week!
What is this?
That was your leg?
I'm sorry.
I hoped she'd just feed
these boys and send them away...
but now I need to take care
of the expenses of 4 weddings!
What?
- We will do it!
- Nice!
But sir, that was not my mistake.
Sir please, can you just
give me one chance?
Please!
I am Uday's mother.
I am Uday's father.
Isn't she really pretty?
Yes, she is.
Going to London for her
wasn't wrong at all!
Thanks!
The boys told me that
my son and you are in love.
Why are you dragging
our names into this?
We are here to ask your hand in marriage.
Take this plate.
I'm in love with your son?
He is the one who comes
after me like a dog!
I lost my job and peace of mind
due to him.
He destroyed my career and my dream
in a single day.
You should be ashamed
to have a son like him!
Get out.
He is here.
- Why did you go there with my parents?
- We thought if they come...
She is already furious with me
because she lost her job.
- Sorry, dude.
- To hell with your sorry.
Dude!
We didn't do anything wrong.
What you did was wrong, Shwetha.
What did his parents
ever do to you?
He goes through a lot
for you.
If you marry him,
he will keep you happy.
There is no place for marriage
or men in my life.
We aren't going to
be with you forever.
You need someone, right?
I don't need anyone.
Listen, Shwetha...
I don't know if Uday
will come back for you.
Even if he doesn't
someone else will.
If you turn that guy down,
someone else will come up.
This society won't let you live alone.
And the men here
won't allow you to live alone.
You really love kids!
You can get married, have a
dozen babies, and live happily!
What she says is right.
Think about it.
We aren't going to
be with you forever.
You need someone, right?
This society won't let you live alone.
And the men here
won't allow you to live alone.
He is coming after me only because
I am pretty and single, right?
IVF is the process that enables
women to have babies...
by impregnating them through
artificial insemination.
In this generation, due to several factors
like food, work style, stress etc...
infertility has become common.
By storing your reproductive cells
in sperm banks and ovary banks...
you can use those stored cells to
have babies even 10 - 15 years later.
Doctor, the report.
Your uterus and eggs are normal.
You are eligible for IVF.
You are a virgin?
Yes, doctor.
Have you thought about this decision?
Yes, doctor.
This baby is everything to me.
I'm ready.
Shwetha!
Are you doing this
out of anger?
It's a well thought out decision!
You fear that you will
fall in love with me, right?
Fall in love with you?
Fine, if you don't like me
I will leave.
I won't come into your life again
and disturb you.
But please don't do this.
Not just you, no man should
ever come into my life again!
Shwetha!
"Is this the quietest the
Milky Way has ever seen?"
"Does the heart ache
spread like wild fire?"
"Is the sky pouring
artificial rain?"
"Where is the
shoulder to lean on?"
"Won't the moons surround me?"
"Won't new sounds break the silence?"
"Won't my heart ever heal?"
Wow!
Congratulations.
Come only if you can.
I'd understand otherwise.
Actually, my family doesn't like
what you have done.
Your mother is waiting at home
to eat with you.
Let's go.
Don't you have any brains?
Can't you see
she doesn't want you?
Why are you still here?
Are you mad?
- Let's go.
- Come, dude.
Come on!
Are you coming with us or not?
Why are you talking to him?
He has gone mad.
He will never listen to us!
How many times have I told you
not to come here?
How are you, dear?
What do you want?
I want my son.
All these years,
he really loved us.
Now is he really mad about you!
You know the reason?
You didn't lie to him.
Just like you said, you have showed
that you don't need any man in your life.
Him included.
How could he ever get over
a genuine girl like you?
Even now, his love for you
remains intact.
He feels guilty that you did this
out of anger towards him...
and his love for you
has only increased.
I'm not saying this
because he is my son.
He is such a good hearted boy...
Don't lose him.
There is nothing left, Uncle.
You need to make him understand.
Mom, does it really hurt
during the delivery?
Why do you ask?
Tell me.
Don't feel sad for that girl anymore.
Think about your own life!
Who was by your side
when I was born?
My father, my mother,
your father...
about 15 to 20 of our relatives.
She only has me.
Even she doesn't know that!
Just marry the bride I find you
and move on with your life!
"These little flowers with sweet smiles;
I send them over to her address"
"As flower petals caress her softly;
I watch happily from a distance"
"There is no tomorrow,
yesterday isn't done."
"Where have all the days gone?"
"I lived by myself, like a lone tree;
But something is happening to my solitude"
"Who is this man?
This man besides me;"
"Like a protecting
garland around me"
"There is no tomorrow,
yesterday isn't done."
"Where have all the days gone?"
"Is this the quietest the
Milky Way has ever seen?"
"Does the heart ache
spread like wild fire?"
"Is the sky pouring artificial rain?"
"Where is the shoulder to lean on?"
"Won't the moons surround me?"
If you bring her
anywhere near this house...
you will never see me alive again.
"Won't my heart ever heal?"
Ambulance?
It's okay, Shwetha.
Don't be afraid.
I'm here.
It will be okay.
Nothing to fear.
The baby is doing fine.
They've taken the baby
for a general check-up.
Shwetha, why are you crying now?
I'm here for you.
Don't cry.
I'm here.
You are here now.
Will you be with me
all my life?
This life is for you.
Do you still love me?
Yes.
Let's get married right away?
I have a baby now.
Shwetha, that isn't just your baby.
It's my baby, too.
Our baby.
Why are you like this?
Do such people even exist?
I'll be there for you.
That's your baby.
Will you take care
of my baby and me?
Definitely!
This is my baby, okay?
This isn't a tattoo.
It's my birth mark.
Can birthmarks look like this?
I've had no love in my life,
but he drew a heart on my hand!
Tell me the truth.
What did you do?
Uday, how are you?
Uday...
the girl is doing that
to spite you.
She will understand your
true love and come back to you.
But nothing can be changed
at that time.
So do it right now.
Change the bottles.
Okay?
You rascal!
- Don't get angry, Shwetha...
- Answer me, you scoundrel!
Is that your baby?
Is that why you took care of me?
I thought you were a good guy.
You scoundrel!
You fraud!
- You cheated me!
- Shwetha...
Who could have given
him this great idea?
It's me!
- Guru, you are here?
- Uncle returns!
Yes, I am back!
- It hurts!
- Where are you going?
- Love!
- Yeah...
Thank you, Love.
You didn't even tell us.
Wait and watch.
- You cheated me!
- What, I gave my life to you.
How could you do something
as irresponsible as this?
No idea what's going to happen!
How could you say that
after everything you've done?
Why are you hitting him?
Rather than buying seeds
from an unknown shop...
the smart thing is buying seeds
from a familiar shop!
Superb, Love!
Thank you!
Phew! They are together.
Sorry.
Dude, all the best!
Buzz off, single boy.
Careful.
This is more painful than
what I went through to unite them.
Love!
Thank you!
Thank you, Love.
Sorry, dudes!
I'll be back, okay?
God bless you.
Uncle!
Shwetha, not that one.
This is our baby.
Why do all the babies
have heart shaped birth marks?
There were three bottles that day.
I didn't know which one was for you.
So I filled all three bottles, Shwetha!
Oh!
Looks like the fertilizer worked on
the surrounding fields too!
- Dude, just escape.
- Listen to me.
Don't, Shwetha!
Mummy!
Uday, the boy looks just like you.
Like a king!
- Thank you, Mr. Love.
- It's okay!
If not for you,
I wouldn't have got Uday.
People have a baby
after consummating their marriage.
But you are going to consummate
your marriage with a baby!
I am so proud of you guys!
Don't bring that up now, Love!
Okay.
Bye!
Where are you going?
Love, I'm still a virgin.
This is my first time.
Let that be.
If you have any doubts
regarding this, ask me.
I'll clear it out.
Love, I saw 2 TB yesterday
and did my revision.
Superb!
- Superb, Love!
- Superb.
Bye!
Bye. Thank you.
No love handled by this Love
has ever become a failure.
You are a great love guru.
If you have any love
problems, ask me.
I am...
coming...
