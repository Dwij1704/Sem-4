Won't they come if you call?
They aren't your men to
come whenever you call.
Shut up and sit.
Gandhi Nagar…
Hey, dear!
No more jinx.
Hey, smarty!
Will you drop me at Gandhi Nagar?
This isn't a lorry to pick
you up as per your will.
Let me find passengers first.
Passengers, right?
The crowd would come if I call.
Shall I?
Go for it then.






Guys heading to Gandhi Nagar…
Come over.
Come… Guys heading to Gandhi Nagar…
Come…
Oh…
I might need a lorry for them.
How's it?
Great work!
Hey, wait…
Sit at the back. Not in the front.
Get in.
You're unusual, man.
Hey…careful with my tail.
Wait! Let me take a puff.
Move aside. I'll get in.
Wait! I came here before you.
That seat is mine.
Spoilers ascend because of people like you.
Go and sit.
Get in…
Get in, madam.
There's no place.
Hanuman! Get down.
Get down.
Get in, madam. Go.
Why the hell are you touching me?
Are you a beauty or what? Get in.
She acts like she's a star.
Hey, wait.
Hello! I need a seat inside.
I have back issues.
Do you have hemorrhoids?
How did you know?
That's easy! Go and sit. You'll get
used to it before you head to the hospital.
Whose lap would I fit in this situation?
Swing in there somehow.
Get in the middle.
Go. Get in.
Push yourself in.
Alleluia! Go to the back.
Hold it.
You look hefty!
Looks like you get paid pretty well.
Hanuman's role is apt for you.
I was perfect as 'Ghatothkach' in the past.
I lost weight due to bad fate.
I have no clue what sort of
people I might meet today.
Sit…
My place is beside you.
Where should I sit?
Hail, Lord Sriram!
Sastry! Why do you block your nose?
I hate that stinky fish.
This smell is nothing.
You'd feel the aroma when cooked with spices.
Mr. Sastry.
Oh! Alleluia!
Today is Sunday!
I am heading to the Church.
I understood, sir.
Go fast.
Begum is waiting for me.
You're active even now.
How many accounts do you hold?
Hey! Nothing like that.
People come to me. I never lookout for anyone.
Oh! Great, man.
No use! I am not married yet.
[PHONE RINGING]
Hello!
Where are you?
Hanumanthu hasn't paid
me for the programme we did.
Didn't he give you?
No.
Just wait.
Listen up, Hanuman!
What, brother?
Why haven't you paid the lady
who played Satyabama's role?
You said you'd give her in person, didn't you?
You always blame each
other and get us in trouble.
Screw you! You'll never prosper.
There is no hope you'd change.
I will deal with it in the next programme.
This is all because of you. Get lost!
You played Krishna's role.
Is it the role of Rama now?
I always loved playing Krishna's role.
My wife insisted me to not perform that role.
Romantic, huh!
Driver!
Yeah.
You aren't a good driver.
Do you know about our troupe driver?
Check on your mace.
Hello!
I'm on my way, sir.
I shall clear all your files within
10 minutes after I reach there.
Will you clear piles in 10 minutes?
My piles are pending. Help me clear it out.
Excuse me! He isn't talking about piles.
He's talking about office files.
Operation starts!
Ouch! Be careful with your driving, man.
It hurts me badly.
Ouch!
You suffer badly, is it?
Imagine how hard it would be for us.
Yes, Shankar.
Okay.
Alleluia.
Alleluia…
I'm heading to church for Sunday mass.
I got it…
Who's that?
Who was that?
How can you do it when people are around?
Why do ask me?
Again?
Hey, mister! Is that you again?
Not me. It must be this guy.
Fish king!
Yes, I am getting down.
Take it.
Your auto stinks worse than my fish smell.
You were at the back. What's the problem?
Cook and eat your fish. Go!
Okay.
Get down.
No need.
What happened?
People get down in a few minutes.
But, they fought for the place.
No one's here now.
Our lives are similar, isn't it?
We have no idea where our destiny takes us.
But, we have so many expectations.
See you.
Hey! Come here.
What is it, smarty?
You got me some passengers.
Here's a token for you.
Thanks.
See you.
Good day!
I'll be there…
Shankar...Stop…
Looks like you're in hurry, master.
I should go to hospital immediately.
Go!
Okay…sit.
Go fast.
Geetha is admitted to the hospital.
Drive fast.
I'll take you as soon as possible.
Don't worry.
Some relations are made in heaven.
I have no clue what my life
would be like in the future.
That is why I accept you with all my heart.
Forgive me if I make any mistakes.
Goddess! She's the girl of my dreams.
I cannot imagine anyone but her.
Bless me right now by bringing her to me.
I promise to celebrate the
upcoming festivities grandly.
Stop overacting.
Cute boy!
Oh my!
Kavitha! Do you know what happened?
Do you remember Raja master?
Her daughter had an issue
and I dropped him at the hospital.
That's why I am late.
Kavi.
Hmm.
There's one nurse in that hospital.
I felt like picking her up.
Hey! Why are you talking
about such unnecessary things?
Okay, then.
Okay! Hold this for me.
Goddess! I have faith in you.
So, I tied this swing.
Bless me with a baby.
[PHONE RINGING]
Hey, buddy.
What are you doing, man?
You're my savior. What are you up to?
Did you earn well?
Why do you worry about money?
Come! Let's booze.
This isn't the right time to booze.
Wait until evening. Why hurry?
Don't buy a full bottle.
Buy something good enough for me.
You can drink whatever you want
and return the remaining, buddy.
I'm not an alcoholic, right?
Is someone beside you? You talk crap!
Kavitha is in the vehicle.
Let's talk later.
Gosh! She might strangle me.
Is it Siva Reddy?
Yes.
You won't save money to
pay auto loan every month.
But, you waste money on alcohol every day.
I'm helpless, Kavi.
I cannot stay put without alcohol.
I can drive the auto if I'm not still.
Stop it.
Buddy…Stop here.
Stop.
Hey! Give me 90 ml.
83…84…85!
That's it?
What is this, man?
I measured it correctly.
Cheating someone at the
petrol bunk might be easy.
But, no one can cheat a drunkard.
Add 5 ml now!
Shut up and come.
Why do you fight for something hopeless?
Come.
You cannot get anything if you do not ask.
Get lost.
Cheers!
Shankar!
How much do earn per day?
What?
How much do you make from auto every day?
200? 300?
Maybe the highest you could make is 450.
Am I right?
Yeah.
I pity you for the trouble you take every day.
Will you do something?
Forget about auto and come with me.
What should I do?
Chap! I am not joking.
I am telling you the truth.
Do you know how much we
can make if we get double head?
Our lives might change in a jiffy.
How will it change instantly?
This is suspicious.
Hey, bro! Come here.
Yes, Brother!
Refill our drinks and get
an omelet or fried snacks.
Don't you dare burn the omelet!
Tell me.
Listen to me carefully.
Double head means double-headed snake!
We hit the jackpot if we find it.
Double-headed snake?
Hmm.
Where can we find it?
Double-tongued people are plenty around us.
Forget it.
Have you heard of black flowers?
Do you know its price?
Not just dust and gust,
we can break through lockers with it.
I want you to join me and we can
settle by doing something like that.
All you like to do is
changing gears and honking.
How much is 1-liter Kerosene?
I am not sure.
50 or 100 rupees I guess. But, why?
I'll get it to scorch this shop.
Hey, idiot! The owner would
smash you if he hears what you said.
Oh no! I forgot.
Everything would get destroyed, right?
Come.
Okay, let's go.
Hey…
What's with you?
Is it a new route or what?
Hey.
Hey!
I drive you every day.
Can't you take me just one day?
Hey.
Control!
Why did you stop without me hitting the brake?
What happened to you?
Is everything okay?
All is well!
Why did my auto stop automatically?
'Venkanna's daughter died of suicide.'
'Ghost plays with everyone it seems.'
I have to head home soon
before I become sober.
Move ahead.
Steady!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Stop!
Close your eyes!
Well done!
[SINGING]
Did I just hear something?
What's with you?
Is it a new route or what?
Did you stop my auto earlier?
I was totally worried.
How did you get into my auto?
You're tiny. But, you threatened me.
What will you do here anyway?
Let's get in. Come.
Come…Come!
Come, my dear.
Come.
This is my house.
Silence!
Does it stink?
No, right?
My wife would drive me out
if she finds I'm badly drunk.
I'll take you inside if you stay
silent without making noise.
Okay?
Hush!
Will you have a drink?
No!
Hey! You should have milk.
I should have alcohol.
Let me have it.
By the way, are you a boy or a girl?
Don't say. Let me find it.
Wait…
You're a boy.
Let me tell you something interesting.
Drinking is injurious to health.
Where did you get it?
I am already sustaining your drinking habit.
Is it an add-on?
Send it away. Eat and sleep.
Kavi.
Kavi.
Kavitha!
She's always like that.
She is short-tempered.
But, she's a lovely lady.
[SINGING]
Come to me.
Sleep…
What shampoo do you use?
You're so soft.
Look at my hair. It is rough and messy.
Where are you from?
Why are roaming on the streets at night?
Did you come to meet your friends?
Huh?
Did you run away from home?
Where are your parents?
Did you do something wrong?
Hey!
Are you afraid your father might hurt you?
Hey! Parents taunt us always.
Why did you run away just because of that?
I did something like this when I was a kid.
I ate and slept at the bus stand.
Sometimes it brings a smile on my face.
Sometimes, I feel like going home.
What's there to do even if I go?
I lost my parents.
Hey! Are you crying?
Oh, my dear! Stop crying.
Everyone is an orphan here.
I am an orphan. You're an orphan.
Everyone is an orphan.
Hey, Kavi. Give me some coffee.
My head reels!
You booze too much at night.
You'll have a headache in the morning.
Why do get angry just for one coffee?
Am I taunting you?
You were hard to handle.
Now, you've got a buddy too.
A buddy?
Who is my new buddy?
I've seen people talking
to themselves while drunk.
You were the one talking to animals.
You don't have any sense, do you?
What are you talking about?
Who came to our house?
Don't you even know what you did?
You reach home tripping!
Come and see this.
I might have puked last night.
Why haven't you cleaned it?
It is our living room.
Yuck!
It is not you!
That puppy did this.
He did it.
My bad!
Puppy?
I am unable to handle you.
How can I handle a puppy too?
Get me coffee soon.
Gosh!
Were you talking about this pup?
It slept in the house I guess.
Not in the house.
It slept on you all night.
You gave your wife's place to a pup.
Shucks! Some people never change.
Were you the one I spoke to all night?
We had a good talk, didn't we?
Hey! Get some food for the puppy.
I am taking care of you already.
Why should I do it for him?
Send it away immediately.
I don't have time for this.
I can't do that work.
Why are you hitting me? Wait!
Okay, come.
I cannot live in peace if you stay here.
So, I'll take you out.
Are you hungry?
Shankar! Did you come with a puppy?
I did not get it.
It somehow got into my auto last night.
How sad! What happened next?
What else? I thought it left.
Later I realized it came home with me.
Kavitha has been scolding
me ever since she saw this.
She would've been happy if she had kids.
You think about raising
a puppy instead of that.
Why wouldn't she get angry?
Some people make things
even harder for others.
Someone like you!
Shankar! Get married isn't enough.
You should make your wife happy.
You are not thinking about that.
Forget it! Feed the puppy first.
I know what to do.
You focus on making tasty tea.
Go… Work on it.
Let's go.
[RADIO PLAYING]
You promised to send it away.
Why did you bring him back?
Are you out of your senses?
Hey! I left it at the tea stall.
What can I do if it comes back?
You start taunting early in the morning.
Stop talking nonsense.
It is right here.
Leave it somewhere far away.
Oh no!
You'd see my reaction later if you fail.
You go.
"You can never rid of a few things"
“You can't get everything you deserve”
“You have to face such things due to ill fate”
“You'd never leave it once you get attached”
“Oh no no…O' God…”
“What's this fuss?”
“I was happy with my life”
“Don't ruin my life by being a part”
“I plead you to leave me”
"My wife ill-treats me if you stay home"
“Stop troubling me by following”
“I am just an auto man”
“Your life was your choice”
"But, you've got trouble now"
Stop here.
Why did you leave this puppy there, brother?
You'd understand once you get married.
Hey, buddy!
Bad timing!
What is it, man?
Did you plan to buy a plot here?
There's nothing like that.
This puppy came into my life.
It comes back even
after trying to get rid of it.
I covered his eyes and came to leave it here.
Are you even human?
How can you leave that puppy here?
People who don't have
kids raise such pups as kids.
You are trying to get rid of it.
It might die if a vehicle hits it.
Give it to someone ready to adopt it.
He can play with them happily.
Will you leave your baby like this?
Are you hungry?
Give it to me.
You touched it without washing your hands.
Strange attitude, man!
I'll meet you at our spot in the evening.
Sit…
What should I do about you?
Time will decide everything!
You don't know about these people.
They do anything for money.
They might sell you to
someone if they find you alone.
Such bad people still exist.
I want to treat you like my friend.
He's a good guy.
He's my childhood friend.
He loves me so much.
He died suddenly.
I should name you after him.
I'll do it.
Gundu!
Gundu is a perfect name for you.
You're a karate king!
Shall we play?
No? Okay!
Your mother might be waiting for you.
Let's go.
Kavi!
Hey! Your mother is angry with you.
Stay calm even if scolds you. Get it?
We're drunk now.
I asked you to get rid of it.
Why did you bring it back?
Hush!
Hey! Stay calm.
Haven't I told you?
Come.
People like you will never understand.
Do, as you like.
Give something for us to eat.
We shall perish later.
I cooked.
It is over there. Go and eat.
Otherwise, starve!
Hey, Kavi.
Usually, it is better to perish far from home.
My wife wants me dead here.
Gosh!
Sit here.
I'll get something to eat.
I'm getting it. Stop barking.
Here it is.
Let's do whatever we like.
No one would question us.
Let people talk!
Let us not bother, my dear brother.
I'll say it once we finish eating!
Wait! I'll feed you.
Here. Eat…
Shankar! A puppy is following you!
[WHISTLES]
Why did they come to this old bungalow?
That couple came for a shoot.
A shoot before the wedding?
It's a photoshoot.
That was my question.
What's special about the shoot?
Will they screen it in theatres?
No! It is the latest trend.
They call it a pre-wedding shoot.
They take pictures before the wedding.
They make a video and
publish their wedding card.
Oh!
It is a love story!
They love each other.
Their parents agreed for their wedding,
unlike others.
Why should they do this anyway?
Just because no one likes you,
why do you envy them?
I am thinking about it.
My love story won't be that simple.
Is it?
I have a different scope.
That's true!
Your range is different.
You'd find a rich one.
You are right.
It that really happens,
my life would settle within a couple of days.
I'll gain her trust and escape with her money.
Shut up, idiot.
Look there.
Sir! Can you give your puppy for 5 minutes?
How much will you pay for 5 minutes?
Tell me what you expect. I shall give.
Come.
Let's get a photoshoot.
Come.
Take him.
Come.
Don't worry. He's a friendly dog.
He's a good boy!
They're clicking good pictures, right.
Excuse me. Why did you abandon this?
Take a few pictures here.
That's a good idea, sir.
Really?
Idiot!
Sir, come.
I'll click a picture for you and Gundu!
Me?
Yes, sir.
Come, Gundu!
Buddy! I'll join you.
Get lost.
Am I not good for a snap?
Hey! What happened to you?
Do you have a fever?
Don't worry.
He'll be fine once I give this injection.
Gosh! I need to pee immediately.
Stay here.
Stay here.
Hey! Stay there.
I'm feeling good now.
Gundu!
Hey, Gundu!
Gundu!
Where did you go?
Gundu!
[WHISTLES]
Gundu!
Hey, Gundu!
Hey! What are you doing here?
Did you come to pee or poop?
This dog is missing.
His name is Simbha.
Oh! I thought you didn't have a name.
Is your name Simbha?
So, you're missing!
You agreed when I said we're orphans,
didn't you?
Did you fight with your parents?
Will you go back?
Shall I make a call?
Go home.
Okay…
I understood.
Give me a minute.
Nothing will happen to you. Let's go.
The sticker is here too.
Let's remove it.
What is it, dear?
You don't want to leave me, right?
I cannot live without you.
I was just kidding.
No one bothers such stickers.
Many people go missing.
No one can separate you from me.
Don't worry. You can stay with me.
There he is.
He's home.
Hubby! It seems this puppy belongs to them.
I called them.
His missing posters are everywhere.
So sad!
Give it to me, sir.
It seems they are missing it
a lot and weren't eating well.
Simbha!
We searched for you everywhere.
Talk to Simbha, dear.
Madam! Let it stay with me.
I will take care of it.
We both got close.
Why would they give us their pet, hubby?
They treat him like a kid.
So sad! That girl missed him so much.
Shut up!
Think about it, madam. - What, man?
What the hell are you talking?
It won't be nice if you say that.
Simbha belongs to us.
We're taking him back.
Hey! Stop talking.
I'll file a case on you
that you robbed their pet.
Move!
Madam! Is it your dog? - Yes.
Are you sure? - Yes, sir.
Take it with you.
Let's go.
Gundu!
Hubby! I made sweet. Will you have it?
You enjoy! Get inside.
Sweet it seems!
My Gundu is gone!
Gundu!
Hubby.
Hubby.
Get up!
What happened?
Loaners are here.
Auto Shankar!
I haven't seen you at the office for 3 months.
I planned to come after 2-3 days, sir.
You came here before I did.
Come.
You've learned things, huh!
You do not respond to my calls.
You disappeared!
But, I don't have a choice.
I came searching for you.
Nothing like you think, sir.
I didn't have much savings.
I got my auto repaired recently.
I don't have money now.
Why do you need an auto, then?
I shall auction the auto.
Both of us should be fine then. - Sir.
Hey! Get this vehicle to our office.
Sir.
Don't talk like that.
I'll come and talk to your boss.
Don't take the auto.
Why would we come here
if you come to the office?
Okay. We shall wait for a week.
Later, your vehicle shall be seized.
Hubby! Breakfast!
Hubby!
Auto…
Where should you go?
Old bus stand!
Stop here.
How much is it?
40 rupees.
Take this.
40 rupees it is! Give me change.
I don't have change.
You should give me the change.
Here! Count it.
What's this?
Why did you give me 50 paisa coins?
No one accepts them.
What should I do with it?
Take this back and give me a note.
What happened now? You cannot
cheat me like you cheat everyone else.
Give it.
Why would I cheat, madam?
I give whatever I have.
How will I get you notes?
Why do you drive an auto
without carrying some change?
I understood what you are
when you gave worthless coins.
You wait for innocent people like me to cheat.
Give me the money.
Stop talking like that.
Give me money if you have it.
Otherwise, leave it.
I shall consider it a charity.
Stop talking like that.
How can you expect me to stay calm?
Are you my father?
I don't need your alms.
I help a lot of people with charity.
Why do you think of yourself?
You and your auto would vanish
if my husband finds out about this.
Be careful with your choice of words.
Take your money back.
Good riddance!
Unlucky start! Shucks!
Get lost…
I don't need your money.
You've got self-esteem
and I have it more than you.
Shucks!
Hey!
Damn!
What happened to you!
He left me yesterday.
Now, you're not working.
Will you leave me too?
Oh! Is it because I lied to the financer?
What else should I do?
I am poor.
I have desires.
I am scared too.
But, life should go on.
Truth sounds like a lie when
heard from a low-class fellow.
God shall do something.
It was my mistake to finance for you.
What else should I do to make living?
How should my wife and
I live if you stop like this?
Give me tea, brother.
Chap! Take this.
Sir! How are you?
We came to see you.
We came here to give you your photo.
The picture of you and Gundu is just perfect.
Did you frame it too?
I don't want the puppy to run away.
I was just kidding, sister.
Where is Gundu?
He's home now.
Oh!
Brother!
Will you give me Gundu if you don't mind?
I like him so much.
Yes, brother.
She keeps thinking about Gundu.
Give him to her. She'll take good care.
No! I cannot do it.
I can understand how you feel.
I had the puppy for a day
and I miss him already.
I can understand how you might feel.
Please attend our wedding.
We'll come…
You too come.
We'll come for sure.
Don't forget to get Gundu!
See you. - Bye.
Bye…
Beautiful, isn't it?
Gundu!
[SINGING]
Sister! Are you cooking?
[TV PLAYING]
He shows Chicken fries on a cooking show.
Why are you cutting vegetables?
Chap! Why did you place his
photo in the place of a couple photo?
Ask him if he's married to it.
Shankar isn't that kind of a guy, sister.
He loves you so much.
Yes. I feel it a lot.
Hey, darling! How's it?
He's just like you!
Superb!
Place your couple's photo somewhere else.
It is good to have a couple's
photo in the Living room.
We won't look at our picture anyway.
Let's go.
He's such a stubborn guy!
See you, sister.
Alcohol doesn't make me happy.
My mind is just blank, Reddy!
Financers came home and screwed up my mind.
Hold on! Stop!
[SNORING]
Hey! Who are you?
Why are you jumping?
Hey, you!
Get down.
Should I?
Hey!
I'll get inside.
Why did you get inside?
Hey! Hush!
Come here.
What's here?
SECURITY!
Secretary!
Sir! Greetings!
Hey! This is not a secretary but a security.
Shucks! I greeted you because
I thought you're a secretary.
Move aside.
Hey! Have you got drunk to create a nuisance here?
Is it your in-laws' house?
Gosh! How can I be their son-in-law?
Their daughter is a kid.
I am here for Gundu! Move!
Get lost…
What's this nuisance?
Security! - Get lost.
Shall I call the cops?
Sir! I am Shankar.
I gave back your puppy.
Oh! Is that you?
What is it? Why did you come at this hour?
What do you want?
I came to spend some with Gundu, sir.
Gundu?
Which Gundu!
That guy over there!
Are you out of your senses?
Shall I call the cops?
Sir!
Just leave from here. - Hey!
No, sir.
I talk to him for a few minutes and leave.
Please, sir.
He's such a fool!
My bad!
Come.
Thank you.
Hey, Gundu!
My chubby friend!
Do you know what I got for you?
Here it is.
Here! Biscuits!
Eat, my dear.
Hey! That is not a dog biscuit.
Don't spoil his health by feeding such food.
Wait, sir. You don't know anything.
Gundu loves this.
He always eats it.
Simbha! Come to this side.
Go, dear.
Your owner is calling you.
Get up…
Sir! I have a request.
What's your problem?
I'll come to see Gundu occasionally.
Please don't mind, sir.
Okay.
But, don't come during the night.
Okay.
You can see him during the daytime.
Okay, sir.
If you create such a nuisance again,
I'll drive you out.
I won't do such a thing, sir.
I won't do it.
See you, sir.
Gundu! Bye.
Hey!
He's not Gundu!
He's Simbha! - Okay.
Send him away.
Okay, sir.
[WHISTLES]
[WHISTLES]
Hey!
Hey, girl!
Hey, girl!
Hey, girl!
Come here, dear.
Mummy…
Gosh! Why are you calling mummy?
Asmitha!
What happened?
Look there, mummy!
How did you come here?
I came this way.
Security!
Hey, security!
Madam is calling you!
Security!
He'll be here soon.
Hey, Gundu! I love you.
Hey, Gundu!
Bye.
Take him inside, fatso!
[VENDORS SELLING GOODS]
Why did Simbha come to you?
He came searching for me.
I am feeding him biscuits
because he came to me.
Take him.
Why would I want your Simbha?
We know how to take care of Simbha.
Crazy fellow!
Stupid!
Madam! Take this biscuit.
Eat happily!
What else?
Mr. Rakesh! Look there!
What?
That auto man is roaming around here.
Is something going on?
Hey, Gundu!
Gundu!
My dear Gundu!
Hey, Gundu! Where are you?
I am here.
Gundu!
My dear!
Hey! Get lost!
You cannot come to visit your
Gundu whenever you want.
Go away from here.
Why do you care?
Go away.
Why did you come when drunk?
I told you to not come when you're drunk.
Security! Call the cops!
Hey! I came here to see the puppy.
Why are you making it a big issue?
Why are you roaming
around here for that puppy?
I came here to take him if you give me.
You denied giving him.
So, I came to see him.
Why are you making it an issue?
If you want a dog, you can buy one.
Why are you coming to my house?
This is my last warning.
If I see you again,
the consequences would be different.
Security! - Yes, sir.
Send him away.
Send him.
Hey! - Get lost.
Get lost.
Hey!
Idiot!
Gundu!
I won't spare you if I see you again.
Hey, Gundu!
I am fine.
Don't worry.
Crazy fellow!
Don't join their parties! They'll ruin you.
Get lost.
Of course, I'll leave.
Nothing to worry!
There is no problem.
Will I make it this time, doctor?
Don't worry, Mrs. Kavitha!
You're just excited.
Take it easy.
Both of you are just fine.
Continue to take the
medicine that I prescribed.
That should be enough.
Hello!
Hello.
What, man?
Hey! Where are you?
We're at the hospital.
That merchant is leaving this place.
Is it true?
Why would I lie?
When?
Today.
Okay…I'll be there.
The doctor said nothing is wrong, right?
You get worried all the time.
Let's go.
Doctor! I've got some urgent work to do. See you.
Okay.
Come, Kavi.
Thanks.
See you, doctor.
Come fast.
Hubby! Wait.
What's important to you than this?
I'll tell you. Just come.
Come.
Hubby!
What are you doing?
I'll give this and be back.
Listen up!
Where are you going?
Come…Let's go.
Oh! This guy is here again. - Sir.
I heard that you're vacating the house.
Can I…
Hey! Make it fast.
Okay, sir.
Lock the gates and follow us.
Go!
He stayed with me for a few days
and I am unable to stay away from him.
He's my life, sir.
I troubled you a lot
because I love him so much.
Is it done?
This is my feeling and I can
imagine how you might feel.
I understood, sir.
Shall we leave?
That's why…
Simbha! Stay calm! - Just once…
I mean, I'll talk to Simbha and leave.
Please, sir.
Give him Simbha once, dear.
Why do you listen to such drunkards?
It is okay. Give him.
Come, dear. Come.
Give me a minute, sir.
That's enough!
I love you a lot already.
Hey, Gundu! Don't you ever think of me?
Why would you?
You got used to the bungalow.
Why would you think of me?
Hey, Gundu! Shall I say something?
You might not know this.
People at the auto stand, temple,
and tea stall ask about you.
Not just Siva Reddy…
Do you remember that girl
who took pictures with you?
She asked me to give you away.
How can I give you away?
Hey! I brought your photo.
Stay here. I'll get it.
Here it is, Gundu! Take a look.
See!
Come here.
See this! You look handsome.
You're just like a hero.
Why aren't you happy?
Hey, Gundu! Will you leave me?
Don't you want me?
Go away.
Your owner is a rich man.
He'll provide a good bed and food for you.
I am a poor guy.
I'll make you sleep on me.
Hey, darling!
Listen!
I got this neckband for you.
[KISSES]
Let's go.
It is getting late.
Hey! Eat well on time.
Be careful! Stay well.
I treated you like my kid.
Let's go.
Come.
Take care, madam.
Simbha! Come here. - Sir!
It is done.
Let's go, Gopi.
Yes sir.
Crazy guy! He's got attached to him.
Yes, hubby.
“You've come like anonymous kin”
“You've created a lovely bonding”
“It is like a never-ending dream”
“This bond never winds up”
“With your little steps…”
“With your lovely games…”
“It cannot live without me”
“And has become more than my baby”
“You're my life, Gundu!”
“Stay with me forever”
“You're my life, Gundu!”
“Stay with me forever”
[MUSIC]
“I can't stay away from you even for a second”
“What am I to you, my dear?
“I am extremely happy when you're around me”
“I have no clue what would I be without you”
“You're my hope, you're my breath”
“You've become my everything entangled”
“You're my love, you're my life”
“I spare no one who worries you”
“You and I are alike”

Hey! Is it you?
Why did you come alone?
Where is Shankar?
Where are you taking me?
Shankar…
Shankar!
Ambulance!
[CROWD CHATTER]
Pick it up fast.
Pick it up…
Pick it up.
Hey…
Lie down.
Lie down and take rest.
Sir! The bill is ready.
Wait, man!
I'll take care of that bill.
Is it unexpected?
Yes, master.
I had this issue earlier.
Nothing could cure it.
I have no idea when it hits me.
You saved me, master.
I would be gone if hadn't reached on time.
That's nothing.
I did not come to you by myself.
Gundu brought me to you.
I was praying in the temple.
He stood beside me.
Look how he's waiting for you.
Hey, Gundu!
Gundu!
Hey!
Hey!
My dear Gundu!
Closest friends don't help us these days.
That dog fought hard to save your life.
He did a lot for you more than your kid.
Nothing happened to me, dear.
[MUSIC]
Why did your mother decorate the house?
Come.
You've come home like sober after a long time.
What's this! No one can ever predict women.
Even a husband doesn't understand his wife.
That's why they say that
women are hard to guess.
Is it?
Shall I speak my heart out for you?
Looking at you reminds me of our wedding.
I want to see you like this always.
It has been so long I've seen you happy.
Your cheeks blush and lips shine.
I want to kiss you.
Stop it.
You might start talking about my beauty.
Take bath and come.
I'll prepare dinner for you.
Why should I take a bath now?
Let's continue this mood
without any more delay.
First, you go.
Take bath and come.
Let's do this later.
Leave me.
Damn!
Kavi.
Go!
Hey!
Oh no!
The electricity guy understood our needs.
Hey, Kavi!
Hey, Kavi!
You're lovely today.
I understood that you've got expectations
when you asked me to come early.
Why? Don't we have desires?
Shall we fulfill them?
Finally,
I somehow feel that its time for the baby.
Our baby girl should roam
around the house with anklets.
I want to hear her call my mother.
It makes me so happy.
She should grow up and
attend school in our auto.
Doesn't it feel good? - Yeah!
Just thinking about it makes me happy.
I know that it makes you happy too.
I understood that you raised that
dog because we didn't have kids.
Once we have our baby,
you'll love her so much.
Slowly, you might forget that dog.
Is it true?
Oh no!
What happened?
What are you thinking about?
Did I say something wrong?
Hubby!
Hubby!
Gundu!
What happened to you, hubby?
Don't you want to have kids?
What are you thinking?
Tell me.
Shouldn't we have kids?
No, dear.
I've been to many temples.
I prayed to every God!
You're not at all worried.
Oh! I understood it very well now.
That dog is important for you than me.
I don't like it but let me ask you something.
Answer me.
Do you want that dog or me?
Hey! Why are you talking like that?
Don't bring him between us.
Oh!
You get angry when I talk about the dog, right?
I've been patient till now.
I can't do this anymore.
You can live happily with that dog.
I'll find my way.
Hey, Kavi! What are you doing?
Why are you planning to leave?
Think about it before you say anything.
You'll understand how you behave.
Everyone says that a dog is more
important for you than your wife.
I cannot hear such words again.
I cannot stay in this house.
People talk about rubbish!
Why do you listen to them?
Go inside.
What should I do by staying here?
This is all because of you.
Get lost from here.
Hey!
Why are you scolding him?
What did he do?
Oh!
You still support your dog, right?
You're right.
I am crazy.
Okay! Why should I stay here then?
I'll leave.
Hey…
Listen, Kavi.
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Listen, Kavi.
You shouldn't get angry about this.
What have I asked you? Tell me.
As a woman, I want to be a mother.
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong to have kids?
Kavi! He's like our kid.
What? Is that dog our kid?
Oh! Is that what you think it is?
There's no need!
I understood that you don't need kids.
See!
I won't stay here if you do not want kids.
Oh no! Kavi!
Get lost.
Hey, Kavi!
Stop!
What do you want?
Decide whether I should stay here or that dog.
Kavi.
Oh no! What the hell!
What's wrong with you?
Hey! She got angry and she left.
What should I do now?
Why are you angry with me?
Have you been waiting for her outside?
She'll come back.
You might get a fever if you get wet.
Come in.
Come inside.
Come, Gundu.
Let me call your mother.
Hey, Kavi!
You called me instead of your wife.
[INNER VOICE]: 'Did I call you?'
Check the number and dial.
Hey!
I called to talk to you.
Where have you been?
Hey!
Idiot!
Are your senses gone along with my sister?
Okay…
Did you eat anything?
Gundu has been damped
in the rain ever since you left.
I should take him to the
hospital if he gets a fever.
[INNER VOICE]: 'What's wrong with him?'
Okay. Hang up!
I'll come and talk to you.
What will you speak, man?
Here! Talk to your mother.
Okay…
Are you coming home in the evening?
Okay. Gundu will come in.
Oh! Are you acting before Gundu
as if you were talking to your wife?
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
I'll get some alcohol.
Let's booze and enjoy it.
Okay. See you.
Come fast.
She said she'd come
back the day after tomorrow.
Why are you still angry?
Why are you stubborn?
Okay! Let's freshen up and pray.
Come.
Come inside.
Come.
Come.
You're lucky to have such a husband.
No mother-in-law or sister-in-law!
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Aren't you worried about
what people might think?
Stop nagging!
I am disappointed.
Serve me one more crepe.
Women leave their husbands if they are bad,
torturing, or if they have affairs.
Is it wrong to raise a dog?
How can you leave him?
I've not seen anyone like you.
What a great father you are!
A lot has happened and you simply
watch TV without caring about it.
Your daughter left her husband.
Before people start to gossip,
find out what her problem is.
Kavitha! Your issue isn't a big one.
You should adjust whenever there's a fight.
The husband might say something to you.
He's bonded to you in marriage.
You should respect him.
Am I right, dear?
Hey! What's your problem?
Ask her.
She might open up to you at least.
A dog is an issue in her marital life.
Damn, mom!
Are you crazy?
How can you leave him
just because he raises a dog?
Let's go. I will talk to him.
I won't come there.
I'll leave this place if I am a burden to you.
You can live happily without me.
No, dear.
What did I say for you to get hurt?
Everyone gossips about
your inability to hold a relation.
Haven't you heard that?
Do you know?
Do you know what happens there?
Do you know how hurtful it is to me?
Is it so?
Did this really happen?
Hmm
How can I ever express my agony?
Don't worry.
I will take care of it.
I'll do something about that dog.
Deal?
What deal?
Whom should I kill?
I need 1 lakh for bail and
1 more lakh for the deal.
Give me money first.
And then tell me what the deal is about.
I will show what I can do.
It is very simple.
Let me tell you what the issue is.
Listen up.
I will take care of it.
A dog?
You mean, you want me to get that dog?
What is your opinion about me?
Ask everyone about me.
They'll say what I am.
Ask them about Joint Srinu!
You'll get it.
Hey! Can you do it or not?
Tell me that.
Okay! I accept it because you are my friend.
Give me the money tomorrow.
I got it.
I know what you want.
Here it is.
Oh!
Keep it safe in the locker.
Once we get the gift, we should start working.
This is Joint Srinu's promise!
Brother! Stop…
Hit the brake.
Stop…
Stay here. I'll be back.
This is the right time.
Give me those biscuits.
It was suspense with thrill and chasing!
I was tensed and finished them all.
Give me the kebab!
I did the same, brother.
We'll leave you if you do that again.
You'll be left out.
That's it.
How should I get that dog?
Take this cover with you.
It will come sniffing the kebab.
Lock his mouth!
Then, you can grab him.
Is that so?
That's it.
Let's go.
Come…
Come…
[GROWLING]
Come…
Boss! Did you get the dog?
The dog bit my boss.
Hang up!
It won't leave me.
Wait! I am coming
Hey! Kavitha is here.
She's been here for 4 days.
She hasn't gone back.
I have no clue what happened.
She's never been home this long.
Maybe she is pregnant.
It doesn't look that way.
She must have fought with her husband.
Hey, Kavitha! How are you?
I am good.
How are you?
I am fine.
Hey! Are you expecting?
What did you say?
I am asking if you're pregnant.
Why are you worried about me?
Looks like you've got some work to do.
Mind your work.
I asked you because I
saw you after a long time.
What's that harsh reply?
Why do you worry about me?
Will you solve it?
Oh my!
I thought you've changed.
But, you are just the same.
She indeed fought with him.
Let's go.
Come, guys.
Come, guys.
Give it to me.
Take it.
Oh no…
Someone is trying to abduct me.
Gowri!
Santhamma!
Venkamma!
Come fast.
Hey! Stop!
[LADIES WARN]
Sister! Leave me.
I plead you.
Hey!
Bloody idiot!
Sister…
I plead you.
I am innocent.
I am not that kind.
Look at him.
He changed in just half an hour.
Brother!
We ordered special tea for you already.
Sip it up! Otherwise, it might get cold.
I am damn hungry.
Halt at a hotel.
We shall have lunch.
Hey! Let's eat here.
Here?
I heard they cook dog meat.
Go ahead!
Let's go to some other place.
You always eat your favorite, isn't it?
Where should I go?
Hey! I forgot to tell you.
Our neighbor Sridhar
Goud invited us for lunch.
Take me there.
We shall have good food there.
Hey!
You still remember some other places, right?
Come!
Come, Shankar. - Greetings, brother.
How are you doing?
Why are you late?
Nothing much to say. - Greetings!
Life goes on! - Greetings!
Greetings!
Have lunch and go, brother.
Gowri! Look who's here!
Did you forget us?
I haven't seen you around.
I was little busy.
How are you?
We are fine. Didn't Kavitha come?
There's a ritual at her maternal home.
I dropped her there.
Oh! Is it?
How's your work going on?
Don't even ask about it!
I brought someone and got him tested.
Stop it.
He is hungry, brother. Don't bother him.
Okay. Let's finish the prayer and go.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
Shankar! Worship!
Isn't it why we are here?
Okay… let's go.
Come…
Come.
Let's go.
Come, Gundu.
Gundu! Come. - Come.
Hey! Serve them.
Gundu! Come here and sit.
Hey! Did you get it served?
Hey! Get curry.
Serve me some.
Eat up, Gundu!
What happened?
Eat.
Eat.
Why isn't he eating?
Why?
Isn't mutton tasty?
Adjust for today and eat.
Hey!
Gundu!
Hey!
Where is he going?
You have it. I'll be back.
Why did Gundu come here without eating?
Did you forget?
This man's kid came with a
lamb and played with Gundu.
Hmmm.
Gundu and that lamb are good friends.
Oh!
Gundu thinks this is that lamb.
That's why he is feeling bad.
Oh!
Where is it?
I cannot find it.
Hey!
Brother?
Go there and stand.
Okay, brother.
Take this.
Hold the sack and stand here.
Okay, brother.
I'll be in the front.
Brother! Where is the sack for me?
Hey! Who will shoot it if you hold the sack?
Brother!
What's that for?
Brother!
My dad gave me toy guns during my childhood.
You gave me the original gun.
I am happy, brother.
Aim properly and shoot.
Aim the leg!
Okay, brother.
Hey!
Not me! I said about the dog.
Go for it.
Okay, brother…
Brother! What about me?
I gave you the sack, right?
Work on it.
Do you get it?
You should put it in the sack.
If it misses, I will grab it.
Okay, brother…
Okay?
Come on! Move!
Okay, brother.
Biscuit! Come forward with the gun.
Hey! You come forward.
Hey, come on.
Grab it…
You cannot let it go today.
We missed it last time.
[BARKING]
Grab it!
Throw the sack on it. Come on.
Hey! Shoot!
Hey! I asked you to shoot the dog.
Why did you shoot him?
Hey! It is coming towards me.
Hey…
It will get me again.
Hey…
I plead you.
Save me…
You got one bandage.
Within a half-day, it bit you again.
What would happen to you
if it bites somewhere else?
Sacks don't work.
Yes, brother.
My next deal would be different.
Okay, brother.
I have another plan for it.
What plan?
Do you know what this is?
What is this, brother?
It is an old one.
Scent bottle!
Is it, brother!
It won't get up for three
days if you spray this.
What about excretion?
Will you try?
No, brother.
Brother! Will it work?
It works indeed.
Brother! Is the dog here?
He won't grab the dog.
There won't be sunrise.
We have to stay here all night.
Why did I promise to get the dog?
My life has become pitiful because of that.
[SNORING]
Brother! I am sleepy.
Who's that?
Brother!
It is the dog sleeping right before us. See!
It did not sleep.
I sprayed this.
Brother!
[WHISTLES]
I keep my promise.
Joint Srinu never miss any deal.
Hold this.
Oh!
Hey! Did you manage to make me a widow?
It is escaping.
The dog is escaping.
Catch it…
I asked you to hold it.
Why did you leave it?
Hey!
Hey, Joint Srinu!
I don't like kidnapping that dog.
My brother is a crazy guy.
My sister's life would be ruined
if something wrong happens.
Get it?
Let it go.
Hey! Why did you hire me for all this drama?
Do you realize whom you are messing up with?
Joint Srinu! This is Joint Srinu!
Hey, Joint Srinu!
This action is for others. Not me.
Okay?
See you.
Brother! Shall I say something?
Don't feel bad.
Such things don't work. Leave it.
Is it?
[PHONE RINGING]
Let me teach you a lesson.
Brother!
Boss! Will you get the dog?
Or should we get it?
Hey, idiot! You can never get that dog.
Why because we cannot capture that dog.
We've got nothing to talk now.
Hang up, you idiot!
Boss.
Just a minute!
He looks good, right?
What is her problem?
Don't you remember how harsh she was with us?
How can she lead a
happy life with her husband?
No!
I heard that her husband is an auto driver.
He must have got an affair.
Ask her if she'd come or not.
What is it?
Why don't you talk?
Ask him to send that dog away.
Later, I'll talk.
What do you say?
Hey! Is it an affair?
I might adjust if it was another woman.
That dog!
Oh no! Is it about a dog?
People like her take silly things seriously!
Her view is different! What a great lady!
Hush!
Listen to me now.
I do not take anyone's side.
All I talk about is justice.
Listen to me now.
I don't care what you say.
I won't stay in that house
where he keeps a dog.
Gundu! Come.
Hey, Gundu! Come.
Come…
Where are you going?
Hey, Gundu!
Hey!
Come here.
No one understands the way you do.
Come here.
It would've gone by now if it understands.
I am suffering because it
stays by your side always.
She treats the dog like her husband's affair.
That dog sits beside her.
I've never witnessed such a silly fight.
Incapable people give silly
reasons to break a marriage.
That's his situation now.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Tell me what we should do now.
There's nothing to say.
Mother-in-law! Are you rich enough
to take care of her like a princess?
Ask her to come.
This isn't a big issue.
But, she left me for that.
Why do you discuss among yourselves?
I am here, right?
They know how to solve their issues.
They don't need your justice.
Your wife left you 6 years ago.
Go and get her.
[INNER VOICE]: 'Why is she bringing that up now?'
Later, you can do justice to them.
We didn't ask you to come.
This is just a village tradition.
Your work is done.
You may leave now.
Go away.
[CROWD CHATTER]: Let's go!
You gave good respect to me!
Got it, right? You may leave now.
Okay, I'll take leave now, mother-in-law.
See you, father-in-law.
Take care.
What a good caring!
Come, Gundu!
Didn't you hear me?
Come.
Won't you come?
Why are you acting like this?
I am going crazy because of you two.
She won't listen to me anyway.
What's wrong with you?
Okay! You won't come, right?
Stay here.
I am leaving.
Brother-in-law!
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
Hey, Shankar!
I haven't seen you around.
Where will I go?
I head home straight from
the auto stand and vice versa.
My guys didn't find you when they came.
They did not come to me, sir.
Hey! You never picked up my calls.
You weren't found here either.
He's cooking up a story, boss.
Hey! You wait.
Forget about him.
I am asking you now.
Settle up in the spot.
I don't have money to give you, sir.
You deny paying and you're giving
us authority to do anything, is it?
I did not say that.
Hey! Let's not waste our time discussing it.
Bring that auto. Let's leave.
Hey.
Sir!
[BARKING]
'Hey, auto! Come here.'
Hey! Dare to touch the auto if you can!
Then, we'll see who is stronger.
Hey! Money is important for us.
Get the vehicle.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh no!
Hey, Kavi.
Hey! Leave him.
We're humiliated.
Get it settled right now.
Otherwise, I have no idea what I might do.
You got back more than what you invested.
Isn't it enough?
You're a filthy moron who
tortures people for interests.
Take this.
I have more than you need.
Count it.
I will see your end if you dare to rule
anyone as you did with my husband.
Go! Give it to him.

Gundu! The sentiment scene
was good in the movie, right?
It was good.
Mother sentiment.
Hero cried for his mom in the last scene.
I became emotional.
I always wanted to direct a film.
I've written a story too.
I'll tell you that story now.
You listen.
Hey, Gundu!
I was about to tell you a story.
Why are you sleeping?
Get up.
Hey, Gundu!
You already took him to watch a film with you.
Why are you telling another story now?
Will it listen?
Why do you trouble him all the time?
Let him sleep.
I am not sure if he's irritated or you.
You never try to understand my words.
My darling!
I know that you never hold hatred.
Tell me clearly.
Gundu is not just your boy.
He's like my kid too.
I troubled him a lot.
I say many things to him.
But, I am different now.
Gundu shall remain our first
child if though we have kids.
My love for him shall never perish.
Hey, Kavi!
Hmm?
What else is going on?
Is it a good time to talk about it?
Shall we ask Gundu whether
he wants a boy or a girl?
He might say he wants a girl.
Why?
Why because the first child is a boy, right?
My darling!
What happened?
Gundu!
Oh!
Wait…
[CHANTING]
Is it morning already?
Bless us, Lord!
I wish the sun hadn't risen this early.
Why?
Why because I love my moon more than that sun.
Romance!
Enough of it!
Go and freshen up.
Get it?
Why wouldn't I understand?
I understood everything.
If you had understood me this well earlier,
Every day would have been the same.
Okay.
Where is Gundu?
Hey, Gundu!
Gundu!
He must be sleeping somewhere. Check properly.
Where did he go?
Gundu.
Gundu.
He never goes away from me.
Did someone take him away?
Hey, Kavi! I am worried.
I'll go and search for Gundu.
Okay.
Gundu!
Where did you go early in the morning?
Hey, Gundu!
Did you see Gundu?
I haven't seen him.
Okay, You go.
Sister! Did Gundu come here?
No, Shankar! He did not come.
Didn't he come?
Ranga bro! Did you see Gundu?
No!
I did not see him.
Haven't you seen him?
[MIND VOICE]: 'He's not anywhere around.'
'Where did he go?'
'Where did he go? I am tensed.'
Did you find him? - Did you find him?
No, Kavi.
Did you check near the tea stall?
I searched everywhere.
I did not find him.
Hey, Kavi!
Did you do something?
I told you how I feel about me last night, didn't I?
Sorry.
[MIND VOICE]: 'Where did he go?'
'He never stays outside this long.'
Kavi!
I'll check near the stand.
Hmm.
[PHONE RINGING]
What is it, sister?
Why did you call me in the morning?
Brother! Did you come to my house?
Silly girl! Why would I come there?
Will I come back without seeing you?
What happened? What is it?
Gundu is missing.
I am serious.
Bring him back if you took him with you.
I plead you.
I swear on my parents.
I am not at all involved in this.
I won't interfere with your matters.
Anyone who knows your
husband won't do such a thing.
Am I right or no?
Okay. I'll talk to you later.
Crazy girl!
She's unpredictable!
Damn life!
No! Not less than 300.
- That guy agreed to give.
Hey, Vijay! Have you seen Gundu?
No, brother.
Uncle! Did you see Gundu?
No, Shankar.
Sister! Did Gundu come here?
He didn't come, Shankar.
No. I did not see him.
I haven't seen him.
Did Gundu come here?
No. What happened?
Nothing!
[BARKING]
Why is there a crowd over there?
What happened, brother? Why is there a crowd?
A dog got lorry hit by a lorry and died.
Is it?
Chap!
Don't worry.
Why did you stop?
You go and see. Go.
Stay here.
Move.
Move…
Chap! It is not Gundu!
Let's go home.
Chap!
Chap! Where are you going?
Chap…
Hey, Chap.
What happened?
Chap! What happened?
Hey, Chap!
Hold this.
Nothing will happen to Gundu, Chap.
Gundu will be fine.
We shall find him soon.
Don't worry.
Nothing should happen to you, Chap.
Chap…
Hold on! We shall find Gundu.
Hold it tight.
Hold it tight, Chap.
Nothing should happen to you.
Chap.
We shall find Gundu…
Hold yourself!
Chap!
Get up.
Sit inside.
Chap.
Come on, Chap.
Nothing will happen to you.
We shall find Gundu, Chap.
Nothing will happen to you.
Sit slowly.
Chap! Gundu will never leave us.
“Won't you come?”
“Won't you come?”
“Gundu! Without you…”
“My heart stops beating”
“Have you got lost in the way?”
“Did you just depart from me?”
“Won't you come…?”
“Won't you come back?”
“Did you simply leave me?”
Where is Gundu?
Which Gundu?
My dog!
How would I know?
You must have sold him to someone.
Where is my Gundu?
What did you do to my Gundu? Tell me.
What Gundu, man!
Tell me.
Your dog Gundu is gone.
Why are you troubling me for it?
I don't know anything.
Hey… Get up!
I plead you! - Get up, man.
Tell me where Gundu is. I'll get him back.
Get up. Listen to me.
We don't take pets.
I will get it back to you if I find Gundu.
You go.
I beg you.
I already told you that I'll
get him if I find him. You go.
Go.
[WHISTLES]
Gundu.
Gundu!
Chap! What happened?
I miss Gundu.
Nothing will happen to Gundu.
You scare me with such behavior.
I am scared you might hurt yourself, Chap.
I searched for him everywhere
but I did not find Gundu.
We shall find him, Chap.
Don't worry.
Gundu must be somewhere.
Let's remember everything.
Hey, Reddy!
You said about one hotel, right?
You said they sell dog meat.
Yeah. Let's go.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
What do you want?
What do you have?
Mutton Biryani, Chicken Biryani…
Mutton Chops, Boti, liver…
What do you want?
Get us muttonchops!
Just muttonchops or do you need ragi cake?
Get one cake too.
Okay.
Go away, man.
Is it that?
What are saying, man?
It is goat meat.
Taste it and then talk.
I'll say…
I'll say once I am done eating.
Crazy fellow!
Hey!
I brought 10 kilos of that
meat and 5 kilos goat meat.
I asked for 5 kilos of
this and 10 kilos of that.
What did I ask you and what have you brought?
Adjust with 5 this time, boss.
There is no stock.
Take this.
Bring the right amount from tomorrow.
Thank you, boss.
Hey, Reddy! Hold this.
What is it, Chap.
Where are you going?
[BARKING]
What's this?
There are so many dogs.
Chap! This looks like gambling.
Let's go inside and check.
Hey, pinky! Business is not so good.
What should I do?
There have been raiding and conflicts.
They denied our meat and us.
Not just that.
I get scared while traveling too.
You don't have any problems.
I am the one who should answer the boss.
[BARKING]
Hey, Chap!
No!
I am scared. Let's go.
Hey! Nothing will happen.
Stay here.
I'll be back.
Hey, Chap. Be careful.
Here! Take this. Give that to me.
Come.
Come.
[BARKING]
Chief!
Hey, send husky to the city.
Do the delivery once the money is received.
Otherwise, don't do it.
This isn't eating well.
I am not sure if it stays
well until we reach the city.
Take care until the delivery is done.
Later, owners shall take care of it.
Okay, chief. See you!
Chief! There are breed dogs here.
How does it work?
Hey! Don't try to know more
within three days of joining.
Organs are exported.
That's how we make more money.
Leftover meat is good for our salaries.
Go… Go and do your work.
See you, brother.
Gundu!
Hey, Gundu!
Come…Come!
Come, Gundu!
How have you been?
Come... Gundu!
Nothing will happen to you.
I'm there for you.
Let's go home.
Gundu!
I'll take you home.
Gundu!
Gundu!
Hey! Who are you?
Hey, Gundu!
Gundu…
Hey!
Hey!
-Get him.
Hey...
What the hell are you doing here?
Rascals! How can you sell dog meat?
Hey! Let's finish him along with those dogs.
Don't go overboard just
because this is your place.
I'll smash you all.
What, man!
What, man?
Chap!
Hey, Reddy!
Hey!
Hey, Reddy!
Siva Reddy!
Hey.
Hey!
Hey, Reddy!
How did you get in?
I asked you to close all gates.
I warned that no one should get in
and get to know what's happening here.
But, how did they get in?
Mix his meat along with dog meat.
Are you even humans?
Filthy rascals!
You'll be finished.
I'll offer you to the Goddess.
Why are you boasting, man?
What will you do?
What will you do?
I'll tell everyone about your business.
I'll see your end.
Weren't that easy to stay calm.
I'll stab you and finish you right now.
How did he come here?
What are you all doing?
I should finish you first.
Boss! It seems his dog is here.
He sneaked it without our
knowledge but we got him.
Where is that dog?
Get it here.
I will kill it right in front of him.
Hey! No!
Gundu!
Gundu!
Gundu.
Hey.
Hey, Gundu!
Leave me.
Leave me.
You bloody!
Hey!
Thrash him.
