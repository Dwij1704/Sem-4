Jai Hind, sir.
Sir ..
What is the matter of police officers?
 in the army camp?
My name is Imasuangi.
Police inspector in Balarum area.
Last night the pub was under care area
I had a fight.
A soldier involved
in the incident.
Proceed.
Midnight last night, I have been
received a call from the pub.
It is an emergency call.
- Why?
- I do not know, sir.






From the beginning it all goes with
 smooth, suddenly a fight broke out.
It ends up quickly.
What?
I always see 10
people hit one.
But he was just one
has hit 10 people.
This is my lifetime
I first saw it.
Who is he?
Where are he?
- Constable, go find him.
- Sir, sir ..
Where are you looking for?
He did not go anywhere.
She was sitting inside
alone while drinking alcohol.
Who are you?
Who is ..






Who are you?
Why are you hit them?
You ..
Why are you hit?
Because I'm angry.
What?
Because I feel angry.
If you're angry,
You're a little stupid
He is the son of the minister.
What minister?
Not his only son, the minister
 I was willing to hit.
Tell me why are you angry?
Sorry, I'm really sorry.
Sorry yes ??
You dare to touch me.
- Excuse me.
- sorry?
Beautiful woman
I, you all touched ..
Just look at it instead
tell me I'm sorry.
What's on you
to see me?
Release me.
Apologize. Speak!
Speak!
Sorry.
Go.
Hey! Who are you?
You shame my girlfriend?
You better leave her.
Because he told me everywhere
the man at this disco looked at him.
Baby
Who are you?
What's your name?
I never saw
he's here. Who are you talking to?
From the conversation
as he is not from the north.
South? Come from the south
to the north why brazen?
South India, go!
South India.
North India.
East West.
Is not it all
is in india?
India is just one.
Let me tell you now.
My name is Surya.
My home is Indian.
Little things like that,
should you hit them
That's my real problem.
I do not like to pace slowly.
Actually to enjoy it is not
just an appointment, but a fight.
Sir, I did that.
If I'm hungry, I'll be full.
If I'm sleepy, I'll sleep well.
If I'm angry,
I'm going to hit me enough.
I refrain from this.
There is a notice board there.
But since you even smoke,
I think the board is worthless.
Babu, bring a cigarette ash.
You're getting more interesting.
But this is a problem
with the minister.
It's not interesting anymore.
Okay, let's go.
For me 10 thousand, write a letter
apologies and signatures.
You're sorry ...
Or want to get bribes?
Why, you can not
give a bribe?
He knew he was not talking
with whom?
Hey, you know you're in
where now? You know no?
My police station.
Just listen to me, write a letter,
for me 10 thousand and you go back.
I will not give a bribe.
I will not apologize.
You want me to show
 polythe's power?
Raise your hand.
Beretta M9
Five inches for 50 miles.
The total amount is 170 grams.
Sir, he told me
I am early.
He will not hit
people without reason.
But I did not understand
warning him.
Now, I'm not coming
come here to find a problem.
I came to take my gun back.
So now, uniform police
I lost my gun.
Sir!
Where is Surya soldier?
5 minutes before I arrived
I see him in block B, sir.
Tell him to see me soon.
Wait, wait!
Block B, is not it
terrorist prison?
What did Surya do there?
It's very tasty.
Only tomorrow please bring me
.. with shrimp once.
You will not have that chance.
That's your last straw.
When you finish eating,
I will kill you.
You trying to scare me?
You remember I'll break the secret ..
..and betray my country?
You've betrayed it
your country.
Actually if you
really love your country.
You'll think like that
how to advance the country.
Not thinking what
to destroy India.
Actually I want to know,
 You put a bomb in India ..
.. but why do not you bomb
your own country.
Are you weak?
So why are you a school bomb and
kill innocent children?
Your fate is not so good, you're right
terrorists and I have to kill you.
If I see you at the scene ..
..i sure I killed you first
before the explosion occurred.
Your fate is not very good
but you know ..
..you'll die like a fool,
and you should not die killed ..
..by a soldier.
Who gave directions to shoot?
Tell me who
who shot a shot?
Nobody, sir.
So why are you firing?
Because I was very angry.
What?
Because terrorists are trying to destroy
my country has been well served.
That's what made me angry.
You remember we purposely gave it
good service to her?
You know no terrorists
 have evidence.
Sir, what evidence is there?
Previously we held one
the criminals for months.
We wrote a letter to Pakistan
 about his detained people.
And they easily answer, address
not worthy and they do not recognize it.
So you killed him?
In the army there is a rule!
Can not follow emotionally.
There are 600 military personnel in this camp.
How many awards? is that
 one achievement? How many medals?
And in all that just
there is a black dot.
You!
I noticed
 you for 7 years.
Every day there is
 complaints about you.
The book is full of reports
Your name is in red ink.
As a soldier,
You can not control yourself.
Always fight and you're not
anyone is just a human being.
I'm a normal human but I'm there
 explanation for each complaint.
We have no time to
hear your explanation
You do not deserve to be here.
From my first day here,
I told you sir.
I'm not worth it here.
Send me to the border.
But nobody is
hear my request.
Did you hear that?
Borders?
If Surya is a soldier available
Defend the country, I'm willing to send you.
But if I send you,
you are the one who will start the war.
Not surprisingly you are
which started a third world war.
If your dream is to go to the border.
Forget it. Because it's not
will happen in your life.
Because you've been
beyond that border, Surya.
Because kill the suspect below
military detainee without instructions.
You did not
can be controlled, Surya.
Out of control is meaningful ..
Out of the army.
Tuan.
You're no longer a military officer.
You are fired.
Sir, sir, for a moment.
Indian Army Gate
is closed for you.
I can explain, sir.
Shut up !!
You know your ability, Surya?
You can be a great soldier.
Now go out.
We hit you up
the commander of the Colonel.
Do not keep it
all this in the heart.
We just run the instructions.
Why are you doing it?
Your job is so honest?
Go.
Mak ..
Mak ..!
You do not mind?
- Dad (Dad Lift)
- You still do not change?
The Colonel instructed you to come out,
dare to kick the door firmly.
He's the Colonel!
Actually all my mistakes.
10 years ago I was
 see you at the curb ..
I suppose you like
your own child and make you a soldier.
That's my fault
the biggest.
Wake wake. Let's go.
Why sit back, let's go.
Where?
Where are you?
You still do not know?
You've been removed from
military troops.
Now you are like me,
only ordinary soldiers.
Let's go.
Dismissed?
How much can they get rid of
me? Can they do it right?
If they throw me off,
I still do not want to go.
- Do not want to go?
- No, do not want to.
- You behave like slaves.
- I do not want to go.
If you continue this way
in a few days you will die.
Let me die, dad.
But not here.
I will die at the border.
Borders, borders, borders.
What's in there?
What is there?
I do not know what the response is
You're against India, dad.
But to me, India is my home.
Alone maintaining
border.
Billions of people will be brave
because I'm on the border.
They will sleep so much.
Not enough feeling
I'm that, dad?
So say, why
I need to go to the border.
Yesterday, Hanumanta's father died.
After the war on the border.
Everyone is sad,
and I was crying too.
Everyone was crying
because of his death.
I'm just wondering why
I'm not in his father's place.
He is very beautiful, dad.
That's my dream.
What else is a soldier?
need more than that all.
This is the problem.
How big is your dream,
so is the magnitude of your weakness.
- Really?
- Yes.
I will change.
I will change.
That's what you said first.
- Really?
- Yes.
This is the last time.
Oath to father.
Oath to father.
Oath to father.
Move your hands
from my head first.
Maybe not the last one for
You, but it's the last one for me.
Oath to you!
Colonel, Surya there's a weakness, sir.
But he has the advantage
as a soldier.
He's good at controlling
all the problems.
He can be the leader.
I'm not sure.
Sir, he is a shooter
best and reliable
That I know.
But I'm still not sure.
Sir, more than that.
He loves the country very much.
And he's willing to die for it.
- Soldier.
- Yes sir.
Are you willing to die because
defend the homeland?
- Sir, I'm ready to receive instructions!
- Thank you.
I know you do not exist
better reason than this.
Good day, sir.
Yes sir.
It's great to chat with you.
Tuan.
We always give you a chance
Pakistan to change.
Surya urang man.
Last chance, sir.
Last chance.
- I'm sure.
- Thank you sir.
But with one condition.
When did Colonel want me to report?
Forget it.
99% you will not have a chance.
1% is there?
My appeal did not work this time.
Colonel Kenken asked for a signature.
Well we go and
get it. Who?
You can not.
 Forget it.
Dad, do not act anymore.
Who? Chief Minister?
Prime Minister?
If PM is okay,
because before this PM Modi ..
..have fun with the assignment
I was when he was here.
If he is, it's easy.
I can find him alone.
CM. PM.
Not both of them.
He's an ordinary person.
Professor of Psychology
number one in india.
One of the three
best in the country.
Head of Psychology.
Dean of UPFL.
University of Psychology and Foreign Languages.
Many figures
got his signature ..
..and served as a
important people in the country.
He could easily read
one's thinking, from face to face.
Her name is ..
Professor Rama Krishnam Raju.
You remember no longer, he's a father
which you have removed 10 years ago.
Easy conditions.
Your progress report
need to be signed by him.
In conclusion, you need
your father's signature ..
For you to go back to your post ..
And continue to be placed at the border.
One signature only.
And your dreams will come true.
It might be easier to
get signature PM Modi ..
But it's hard to get you
your father's signature.
He said the master was his father.
So this is a confirmation.
Dad remembered to sign
your report book.
But I did not think it
it is in the police station.
I'm shy to look at you
your face again.
Fights and anger
at this age is not good.
Everyone finds father
if they have problems.
How much do you have if you have a problem?
Dad did not think that dad
Learn this way.
Not educating dad,
but i am great.
Actually I want to know, my dad
as what? Grass in the lawn or dog?
Not me alone, anyone
will do this in my place.
Listen here, anyone can
act like that.
But the son of Krishnam Rama did not
can do that.
Oh, so the problem is because
son of dad behave like that?
Yes.
Okay. I understand.
So suppose my father had no children.
Suppose the father has no children.
I will go.
I'll get out of here.
I will not look in the face
father of my life again.
I want to see you
Professor Rama Krishnam.
- Are you a soldier Surya?
- Yes.
Major Kishore.
Why, is it because I'm Major?
Serious joke.
Get in.
Thank you.
Sit down.
Hello
Hello
You want me to call
what are you
Surya.
How about you?
Everyone calls me sir.
- Sir.
- Sir.
Good.
So, come back
on our business.
Tell me about
yourself.
I mean,
who are you.
I am a soldier.
I asked who you are,
Do not ask your job.
I asked who you are.
Now tell me.
Who are you?
I am a soldier.
In others, who are you,
who are you different?
But to me both are the same.
Surya is a soldier.
On you Surya is a soldier.
But in society
Surya is anger.
So as a change,
what we said about Surya.
Now tell,
who are you
Tuan.
Sir, I just need to
your signature.
If you want to answer me,
First I have to understand your questions.
From who you are, who you are,
Ask a simpler question.
I will try to answer as much as possible.
Well, Mr. Surya.
Time is up.
- Sir?
- We're talking tomorrow.
At 11 o'clock in the morning.
If you can ask now
and signature ...
Listen.
It's time for family. I do not want
compromise for any case.
11:00 am right.
What he did best
about the case?
He remembered me by that chicken
caught in a prostitute?
Ask the right questions,
and a signature where it should be.
I can go back tonight too.
You mean, see him early in the morning,
get her signature ..
..whether and move from
here at night?
That's a joke, Major?
I've been waiting for a year.
And I still hope.
You mean you're not his personal assistant?
PO.
Passport officer.
I used to be the signature
at all that's in need.
But now I'm the one
he got his signature.
Know how hard it is?
I see him every day.
Look.
I'm not feeling well, Kishore
Where do you get the berry?
If you do, there's a shop
Blue Mirror is there.
What we said to the bar first.
Thinking where to get it
best berriesi.
Where do you want to run?
Do you all see?
Go on!
Oh god.
Good luck safe.
Yes. Good luck he is safe.
Hey, you know who he is?
He's the Challa kid.
Challa, who is it?
Serve for me too.
Serve.
What's the problem now?
Is the land problem?
The land belongs to you.
It's your business, PC.
And it is not wrong.
But then you're there
Say something to my kid.
Challa tu orang apa?
He lives because people are afraid of him.
But no one
who are afraid of it here.
Go.
You've dropped my ego and my face, PC.
My courage is because of myself.
My courage is also because of me.
That's why I'm brave
come alone.
My dad always said no
too much ego.
Fear of death
 will fly.
This food is very good.
After eating if
 I do not sleep for a moment ..
I can not move back.
Brother does not include ego. Please.
Okay, this is for recording the report.
Well, how's the relationship
you with your family?
We've been separated for 10 years, sir.
Why?
My dad and me
not so good.
That's why I got out of the house.
Have a friend?
Friend.
Surya, he's our friend.
Friends or not I can
hit anyone.
Hey, just drink it. Put a glass.
Get up. You go!
Get out.
Cis! Wrinkled glasses too.
Girlfriend?
Sir?
Who's Joty?
He only..
What is it?
Happiness ...
Actually, it's just
the attraction then.
Sapna.
No sir, that's all
during the camp.
Who is Varsha?
A girl who ..
..i love full heart, sir.
Actually it is a relationship
very beautiful love, sir.
I want to hear
story about it.
I do not think that's good
telling me about my love story.
I do not feel shy about the story
You are so romantic anyway.
If love must have a fight.
That's right.
My love story.
Start with a fight.
Friend, I stretched out a hand
to help you.
One hand given is
to help others.
And one hand for
upholding the national flag.
Not for
touching women.
Apologize.
Sorry brother.
It's for you.
This uncle is Surya.
Hello
Do not you?
My boyfriend, uncle.
And I want to marry her.
Then, keep it safe
food for him.
Unwilling
want to part with it.
If you can not part with it,
go in and bring coffee first.
Go.
Can connect last post
You brought out coffee.
Go.
Come here, sit down.
My nephew's just a month
 come here for a holiday.
You are clever enough to fasten it.
Not my uncle, I'm charming
Varsha for 10 days.
Is that a guitar?
Aunt very clever.
Aunt really fast.
Save my speed first.
But you slow down your speed.
Do not cross the border.
Borders.
I do not know.
I am always looking forward when
I will step foot on the border.
Youngsters..
Do not stop me.
I was a breeze. Actually
 24 hours is just what I think.
My goal is
to the border.
Is there a goal like this?
Huh! What do you think?
I do not mean anything.
You know the situation on the border?
I do not know.
Blood boils.
- Ever seen borders?
- Never.
Actually, it's hard to go see
border at this age.
If you go see it, it's hard too
for you to stand up.
It's very dangerous,
do not try it occasionally.
Oh god.
Is there coffee or not? Fast
take out. She will continue to drink it.
Have you lost your mind? Why
break home?
Because I can not
break his head.
Why would he have to beat him?
6 months ago he was hit by the head
father in the middle of town.
Go!
- Where's Daddy?
- Yes.
But Surya did not even remember dad
People who do not usually remember
But that was to hit
always remember it.
And dad will make him remember
on his father's lifetime.
My love story
starts with a fight.
She walks romanticly, sir.
Every day with a song, morning song,
evening song, night song ..
Midnight with the song.
Apologize.
I am not interested
with your song.
Tuan.
So why are you separated?
We parted because of it
the fool among us.
Why is he here?
What is his relationship with the soldier?
He's a soldier, do not know?
Baba, Baba, Baba ..
After this no more
the song in your life.
Why are you uncle?
Not as you suppose,
he's a soldier.
- Surya is not a musician.
- What?
I am a soldier,
army is my life.
This is just to waste time.
I will come back
serving a week again.
Why?
Varsha.
Varsha.
Can I give a cigarette?
No, you can not.
I do not know why Varsha
just go away.
He did not answer the phone.
He did not reply to the message.
Feel like crazy, sir.
After a few days, one morning
I open the door. And Varsha appears.
- Surya ..
- Do not talk.
Varsha, do not say anything.
Surya, I'm sorry.
Please hear, please.
Do not touch me.
Do not hold me.
Please listen.
You're a very good one, Surya.
I can not
fight with you.
Because I love you
is because of your work.
I suppose I own
the life I want.
But suddenly you say music is a hobby,
I do not know you're a soldier.
I feel very sad.
That's why I'm silent.
Crazy right
I can not live without you, Surya.
I want you.
At any rate, I want you.
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.
I really miss you Varsha.
- Do not leave me anymore.
- No, it will not happen again.
It was 4 days I was in this house.
Feel like crazy
I just want to get out.
I want to get ready for a moment.
I'll play the song for you.
Surya.
- Yes.
You do not want to talk
with my dad?
About what?
About us.
Okay, we're talking after
I shower and get ready.
Actually Surya ..
We have to talk now.
- Now?
- Yes.
If we talked with
it is clear then we will feel calm.
Clearly?
Explain what?
Surya, please understand.
Anything ..
You're a soldier.
I took the time
long time to receive it.
Either my dad will
agree or not.
Hey, stop, stop ..
Do you all consider soldiers
is it like a criminal?
- Surya do not be angry.
- Shut up!
As a soldier
should we explain it to all?
Do not be angry, Surya, please.
How angry? I'm not angry.
I asked calmly.
Look at me.
If I go ask your dad, I will
explain about soldiers, if you do not agree?
Talk first.
Move your hands. Move it!
I'll talk to her, if she's
agree, okay. Otherwise, how?
- If not what?
- Why do you think so?
Do not want to dance.
Answer my question.
Surya, you hurt me.
- Answer!
- Please, release your hand.
You've got my question first.
Varsha, if it's okay,
 if not what?
- If it's okay?
- Forget me!
Forget me.
Forget you
You need your father's permission
to get married?
Every day into the room,
up on my bed ..
- Surya, stop it.
- Which do not need permission?
Do not say that,
keep your speech.
If I'm angry,
right. I will not act.
What has happened?
Who told you to go?
Get out!
He's my uncle.
That I do not care.
This is our personal problem.
You do not have any dignity?
You do not understand?
Surya, you hit me aunt?
I've hit a comedian
this is 6 months ago.
It's not difficult
I want to hit him again.
So you remember the incident?
How can I get it?
forget your face.
I came to introduce myself,
but can you ask this guitar?
Stupid question.
I guess I'm just like that
 my dad but you hit him.
I will not forgive you.
As long as you do not prostrate on your feet
My uncle and apologize.
I'll just look at your face
if my father accepted it.
He's a comedian,
and he's got a brother.
So imagine her brother
What kind of comedian?
If for this,
I do not have to bow at their feet.
Nevermind.
Hey
We break up.
That's the reason for separation.
All fights started
by women.
But lastly,
man is also wrong.
Be smart, sir.
Surya, enough for today.
We'll continue tomorrow.
- At 11 am?
- At 10.30am.
Beautiful jacket.
My former girlfriend
more beautiful.
I miss her very much.
Look at that girl, similar
my ex-girlfriend.
If you remember that, you will
Looks like all the girls like him.
She's just one
which looks like that?
Right, Major.
Is he real like that?
Hey Kishore!
- Yes.
Hey Kishore, here it is!
Surya.
Kishore, here.
Surya.
Hey soldier!
Hi
Hey ... that's my friend.
This is your sandwich.
This sandwich ..
There is no cheese in it.
Do not worry.
I can not believe it.
What?
You'll come to talk when
Looks like I'm here. Invite me to eat.
You are very good.
It's ok.
Actually, I was
Looks like you're in the beginning.
Really? When?
2 minutes before
You see me.
Why is he in a hurry? 
Why not call me?
Actually, I did
want to call you ..
.. but dignity
prevent me.
We had a big fight before.
so what I want to be
face to face with you.
Fear later ..
.. they will assume
 I have no dignity.
Do not count the old story. 
I mean, it's a fight, up
What is the reason I want to talk to you?
- Varsha?
- Do not say anything.
Do I have no self-esteem?
Varsha, I told you accidentally.
You remember me a slut?
After seeing you,
I tried to control myself.
But I dislike shame and
come see you.
Why? Because I love it.
I care.
What?
I have a karektor and
finally i'm not you.
That's the day you asked for a break.
This time let me talk.
I do not need it.
We break up
When did it break, boy
what's wrong?
Varsha, look,
I wear the jacket you give me.
Varsha, I can not
lost you again.
Varsha wait.
Varsha
Varsha
For a living person
among the people ..
.. family, career, best friend, love,
all that needs to be.
But in your case,
all of it does not exist.
There are many ..
..december what your problem is,
but can you understand it?
I understand, sir.
- Do you accept it?
- No.
I admit that I'm hot in temper
but I do not think it's wrong.
Ego ..
Your ego is already there
 in the first stage, Surya.
If anyone is willing to accept it ..
.. it means that person already
used to his condition.
I'm right, I know everything ..
egoism,
my good temperament ..
..and people like you
will be alone.
Go, father will not stop.
But you will not achieve anything
if you continue to behave like this.
In fact ..
..you will be alone
forever.
Hello, pardon me ..
- Why are you laughing?
- There's nothing to you.
Listen here, Surya.
If you do not like it
my words, you can go.
If you do not understand,
ask me.
But do not laugh.
All right sir,
you may resume.
No.
Tell me why are you laughing?
Actually when you speak
so, i think ..
.. something and I am laughing because
the same words.
What do you think?
Sirs will ask you a lot
and finally sir ..
.. touching personal and
my family thing.
What's personal?
Yes or no, you have a question
my relationship with my family?
When you ask, you know
what's the feeling?
Why? You do not know
my relationship with me
It's my job.
Help me sir
I want to know what your signature is about
with my love and family stories.
Everything is in this file
but why want to ask me?
That's the procedure, Surya.
Not a procedure, sir.
Personal satisfaction.
Sir, I'm happy when I'm alone
told me about my failure.
You love it.
The reason ..
All this time the master refused
someone in your life.
But I'm the only one
reject me, yes.
And you do not like it.
I do not know why the sender
I'm here to get a signature.
You make it a personal excuse
to repay my deeds.
You do not think that non-
not and be ego with me.
Ego!
What are you talking about?
I'm in the first stage of the ego?
But the master noticed, the ego
are you in the final stage?
After years
we both did not meet.
The other person's father will ask
on his son ..
..speed, not you who, sir.
Everyone thinks Prof.
Rama Krishnam ..
Great, talented Psychology
but I do not see anything.
I only see
a regular dad.
Sir is not nobody,
is just a regular father.
Who are you?
Now I speak
as a father.
Who are you for me?
Surya, you know?
Since you came out of life
me, same day ..
..when you came out of me,
you know why
Because, I never
need you.
Marriage requires
commitment.
But I do not need a child.
But it happens.
But you're not born so,
you just exist.
If you are the son of Rama Krishnam,
of course you are the same as me.
Now you understand not?
You are a kid
not needed.
Do you understand what I mean?
You exist on this earth ..
..not a blessing.
Who sent me?
Who was born
I'm what?
Am I asking?
If you're freaking out, you're
apply what's right.
Read a variety of books, but you do not read
book about pregnancy prevention?
Useless psychology.
Surya, you're not
can smoke here.
I can,
and I'll suck too.
I will smoke here.
Needless to fix the lives of others,
but you fix your life first.
Crazy psychology!
What are you saying?
Did you say that?
I'm not in your memory?
Mr. lieutenant!
I am your life!
You're ashamed to suppose
I'm your son and ..
..you feel your name is scratched and
afraid to admit it.
I fear in you.
You're ashamed to confess before
Your student I'm your child.
I'm embarrassing you.
I was a failure
the biggest in your life.
My mom was pregnant with me for 9
months only, but you 're pregnant' ..
..in for 27 years inside
heart to last breath.
You'll just think of me.
You are right.
I am

Unfortunately, I've been
 better than you.
Whether you're trying to fix it
myself or not, ..

it fails in many ways.
And have you ever wondered
 to fix it?
Fear?

Go from my point of view.
What is it? Where are you going?
Actually I do not understand you.

I also have no feelings for you.

Sir, the only obstacle to
I'm going to the border is my dad.
And for that, I am
able to forget my dad.
All right, sir

And I will go from here.
Why do I want to sign?
What else do you want?

as well as my lost love.
You make a documentary

Challa. Child Challa.
Challenge useless ...!
You know who at that hour?
Child Challa.
What are you doing fun for?
to call the name Challa?
You can not do it
are these all alone?
To do this all
you need him?
Move the vehicle !!
What is this, Surya?
You just received it
challenge for 21 days.
It's 20 minutes
 can not be patient.
My dad say I do not want to
problems start tomorrow.
That is, no one can find
problems with me before dawn tomorrow.
So you're going to hit anyone
 just do something wrong?
You know who at that hour?
You came here to get it
your father's signature.
But this city, his father's city.
From tomorrow, you will

It's a fight
life, Kishore.
Not with her dad
or my dad.
But with me.
I am my enemy.
Fight with me.
What are you talking about?
What are you doing fun for?
to call the name Challa?
To do this all
you need him?
There is no father.
I can handle it myself.
Surya already started
the first day challenge.
Varsha.
What is all this?
Shopping. Bracelet. Buddha statue.
That's good. Good for you.
Finally the first day
it's over.
What does it feel, soldier?
Feel like a gun without a bullet.
Can only clean
but can not shoot.
Eat unspeakable food.
Go to class laugh.
Use this object,
I do not understand.
This is your real problem.
You're on the other side,
or even here.
You know nothing
the road in the middle?
There's a way right or wrong,
where's there a way in the middle?
There is, the street name is that
which we call 'management'.
Often, my boys are
follow that way. Cute right.
Management?
Hey! Close shop!
They started again.
- Who?
- Challa people, let's go back.
Come on, come on!
The Challa people always
troubles others on the road.
Children ..
Emak ..
Debarry only lives 1
months to give birth.
But he's got a sense
sick to give birth.
She can not give birth now,
 the risk is very high.
Her dad is not here too.
Give us a doctor
injection immediately.
So please do not
buy the medicine now?
There was a riot outside.
There is alcohol, not medicine.
- I'll bring her medicine.
- Be careful.
Hurry up ..
Take care, outside the crowd
Challa people are hanging around.
Danger, soldier!
- How did the riot elsewhere?
- Everything goes well.
Our people
is there a talifon?
Hey
Come here.
Who are you? Never
Looks like you're here.
I am a new person.
Now riots happen, you're not
Did you know that you can not go out?
That's why I want to go back.
Go.
Hey
What is that?
What's inside
Your hand
Open your hands!
What is this?
There is anxiety, a woman
 pregnant needs it.
There is a riot here, who
who sells medicine to you
No one
sell, I take it myself.
If everyone can take it alone,
why we want to make a riot too?
Not dead or not,
riot remains riot.
I'll guess it's up to 10.
I do not want to see you again.
01:28:03,798 --> 01:28:04,558
01:28:07,628 --> 01:28:08,438
01:28:09,528 --> 01:28:11,268
I still see you again.
Is there no medicine?
He wants to bring it, Challa dah
block him and break the bottle of medicine.
I said, nobody
which can survive from ..
Thank you.
Where did you get the bottle from?
I think it's better to grab more
just for safety.
What ..? You?
Looks like you're thinking.
This is what is called
management.
What kind of management?
One bottle to remove attention,
and one more bottle for injection.
No loss,
no fight.
I guarantee you will succeed
can sign.
All right, he just brought it
medication on time.
How did he get the medicine?
despite the riot?
I told him, he brought the medicine,
but what are you asking?
You behave like that
professor at this house, Raj.
I love him.
Invite her to eat here.
No need.
He only did little help,
no need to pick up home.
I have cooked with
 Janaki's brother's attitude.
That's why I make it
stock food for him.
Please give her, Raj.
Hello ..
You remember who I am?
Why I want to bring food for
the person I'm not familiar with?
Then, pick it up
he came home.
Satya, are you weak?
You want to invite or you
Want to bring this food?
He did not
do nothing but ..
..out watching
food container.
If hungry, eat only.
Who is blocking anyway?
It does not matter, Kishore.
There is another problem somehow.
That's a real mess?
Ban the food
because I buy drugs?
Yes.
For you
You know?
I am a willing man
give food to the enemy.
So do I.
I am a person
able to eat at enemy home.
Extremely correct.
Wash this container and then eat
and send home.
Congrats, soldier!
If he brings food today,
 tomorrow he must sign.
I just bring it, sir.
I remember I finished
Surya problem but the fact is ..
..he still have not faced
with the real problem.
It even if it exists.
Hey, 'medicine', you?
Good luck you came.
The red car is a problem, so you
take him with caution.
Hey you. Get off the train.
- Okay sir. Good luck.
- Kishore.
- Kishore.
- Good luck.
Get down!
Brother Challa, the car is ready.
Hey, get ready.
You know what's most difficult
in this world, Mustapha?
When you have to agree
 with someone else.
No sir ..
The most difficult is when we are
can not or do not agree, sir.
The daughter who
already married.
An aspiring boy
to become a doctor.
Family dependent
You, but you can not walk.
Only money can keep away
distress is not self-respect.
Please use this land ..
..with the best, Mustapha.
Maybe this is just the land for the lord.
But it's like a mosque for me.
This is the award given
by country for soldiers like me.
What i sacrifice ..
..and what i am collecting ..
..I will remember it
when I stood on this land.
Please do not ask for help
I sell this land again.
Mustapha, you do not know about me.
If I want it,
I'm willing to do anything.
That's it, sir.
Now comes four,
previously with 400 people.
You've said to take this land,
The gentlemen used to say
 want to take my leg.
I lost my leg.
But they can not plunder
even a handful of this land.
I am familiar with war, sir.
You want to fight with Challa?
Can you stand?
I once risked
 life before the country before.
If my house is in trouble ..
..I believe in the country
and willing to sacrifice a life.
All this time I remember you only
 stay away from town
But apparently you are far from the community.
Go anywhere, I will
give you 4 days only.
If anyone believes in deeds
I'm wrong, I'll let you go.
I heard you're a former driver
Subash Chandra Bose.
Your son's car is not moving
Smooth, please teach him a little.
Father and son?
Young people, what grandpa
and your dad say ..
... about India,
everything is not true.
India depends on
people like me.
Do not listen to them,
you will be gone soon.
You're too poisonous.
Hey, ready!
Kishore, Kishore!
Where are you?
What happened to Surya?
Challa ride my car and I'll take it
she even places a dog like today.
What are you doing now?
Kishore, he sat next to him
I, he runs ..
business, fraud,
threats and everything.
Let it be, is he
ask you to help him
- Did he tell you to bluff anyone?
- Do not have!
So why are you worried about it?
How much do I worry about?
She made it all beside me!
That's his business. Well done
our business here. Then let's drink.
- Drink?
- Yes.
Kishore, you do not understand the pressure on
in my brain head now.
What pressure?
You remember you're alone
who is depressed? No one else?
Everyone in this country
 can feel stressed.
That's why there is wine.
Drink .. drink!
- No.
Now, take your drink
your feelings and your stress.
The next morning you wake up your mind will
fresh and think management only.
You're noisy.
Are you so special?
Soldier, you're an ordinary person.
- You do not understand Kishore.
- You want to go to the border or not?
Many people like Challa will exist
everywhere, when you go.
- But Challa got my car.
- He's up, you're not telling me.
Drink, drink ..
- Good morning, soldier.
- Good morning, Major.
How do you feel?
Actually last night
I'm too emotional.
That's a great development.
Challa's car broke down, he asked for help,
I share him over. That's all.
Welcome to the club!
Now I understand something about Kishore.
.
We have to accept this life as it is.
- Are we special?
- No.
That is why..
..I want to see you daddy
Varsha right now.
- If anything happens then
- There are two more bottles in storage.
- That's a good development, Major.
- Thank you.
If every day there is
problem, i already exist ..
..long to finish it
every night.
A stunning Indian.
Hey, medicines. Very poor brother
love your car.
So I want to take it.
You're riding a motorcycle.
You will complain in
Karghil every time ..
..there is a problem. I'm not
is there any other work?
I advise you as
a Muslim.
I did not come here as
Muslims, but as ordinary people.
You will not change.
Challa is not an arbitrary person,
better you just sell your land.
Sir as a policeman did not want to
helping pensioners like me.
Why are you talking about soldiers?
red. I want to tell ..
..would you go in soldiers? You are so
soldiers because you're interested.
You're talking like you
sorang yang pergi ..
..great and community
live because of you.
If it's a fight, the police are fighting
every day, we go every morning.
Go and take it back
your medal.
One time he was an officer
but now he's a traitor to the country.
A retired army,
Mustapha suicide ..
.. after knowing
his betrayal is uncovered.
- Oh you.
- Hey Medicines ..
- How are you?
- Healthy.
He's a brother of Challa, he's
will stay here for 2 days.
Please keep him all right.
Think of your own home.
- No drinks?
- Yeah, there's a beer.
Do not want a beer, Brandy is there?
Brandi does not exist ..
Buy it.
Okay. Give me 5 minutes.
- Did you buy beriani?
- You did not order anything.
What do you mean?
Buy it!
Two minutes.
I can not sleep if I do not
friend, so he's my friend.
Wait outside an hour.
See what else,
close the door.
Anwar ..
Anwar, what are you doing?
My father is gone. Mak nak
what's going on with all these medals?
Just throw it away!
Anwar, it's not an ordinary medal.
That's a sign of your father's warning.
- He..
- Silence. Enough! Shut up!
Grandpa ruined my dad.
And my dad broke me!
See what happened?
He's dead!
My father used to be an officer now
is considered a traitor!
Mom, my father did not have to worry about it
because this country will help us.
But our father's body
 not honored.
One day, this country
will know the truth.
There's no soil there. Challa
will get it later too.
You will not understand,
because you are angry.
Do not understand a grandfather
how are we doing?
This country does not care about us.
Again you say
so, be prepared.
Not once would I say,
this is not my homeland!
Enough so far
that pride!
I'll show you a way out,
and I will go from here!
His mother sent food
because Surya helped him. 
So now I help Surya
to get his / her mother back. 
What did you say?
Your son will come.
What? Will he come here?
Do you know
How much does it look like?
Your son, you think
how it looks
Emak.
Emak.
Not one, not two ..
But 20 years ..
Mom would not ask
 why are you running
I will not ask.
But why are you
do not tell mum
Your problems and your dad,
what is the relationship with mama
During this time you are in front of a mak,
but you can not say anything.
How are you and your dad
can you survive?
The men are
always great.
Mom, please.
Do not touch mom.
Never once did the phone call ..
.. to tell your mom that you are healthy.
- Mak, please.
Do not you remember me?
Mother please.
Not like that, man.
Go! Go! Go!
Do not go back anymore.
Do not go back. Do not go back ...
When this challenge starts .. 
.. I remember Surya only
will survive a day. 
But now,
just a day away. 
His dream will be achieved. 
- Are you by Surya?
- Yes.
Our ACP wants to see you.
His son Mustapha, died last week
at the MRW shopping center.
During the investigation, we found out
CCTV recording has been deleted
But we see you
on another camera recording.
You did not notice anything
that strange happens there?
- No.
- Youngsters..
They killed my son,
but they said he committed suicide.
You are just one
evidence I have.
Please remember to go back ..
There is no one there,
Challa or her child?
- No, no ..
- Try remembering again.
Grandpa, he did not remember.
He's not like anybody else, when it seems
but lie and say no.
I know very much with him.
- Ramesh.
- Sir!
You too.
You do not remember, I always have a story
someone important in my life.
Yes sir. Surya Soldiers.
He is the person.
He is my inspiration
with its karektornya.
You remember again. 2 years
last time during training in ..
..Delhi, our group is there
session with you there.
There are all the stories about
dream of each ..
.. but only masters are telling stories
about the meaning of dreams.
Dreams!
Everyone has a dream.
One day it will be achieved but ..
Are you still the same person
as before when your dreams come true?
Is it satisfying enough?
When your dreams come true,
and you got back ..
..you will only see the trip
your life, not the previous character.
When you forget your karektor
Just like you're dead.
Die before dying.
Although there are many
work pressure,
..I never change
my master is master.
No compromise.
Sir, one picture ..?
Yes of course.
Sir, smile a little, sir.
You?
This is a small world.
Soldiers ..!
I had just known about you recently.
I'm really angry with you.
Situation does not permit.
On you are important for
You go to the border.
To me, it is important for me
Get my job done smoothly.
All right, I'll forget it.
And you have to forget all this.
If you can see it
death on the border ..
.. you will not be able to
 see death in Wizaq?
Will you forget or not?
Will you forget or not?
Will you forget or not?
Show your weaknesses
is your strength. Prove it.
Will you forget or not?
Answer it, useless!
Will you forget or not?
I'll forget it.
The students, Alexander have
conquer the world.
Mahatma Gandhi won without
using force.
Surya anyway, won
 against yourself.
You're right, Surya.
I lost.
No one can block you
to the border again.
I will sign it now.
No sir.
Do not sign.
I did not win.
In the process for me to win,
I've broken my own karektor.
People say I'm not worth it, sir.
But I did not confess it.
But now I confess
which I did not deserve.
I'm without a karektor ..
I'm no longer useful
as a soldier.
There's a time ..
I can see
crime is done before the eyes.
But now..
I'm afraid to see
myself, sir.
You always say that
I will be alone.
But I never felt that way.
My self is my good friend.
Myself is my friend.
Now I have everything,
family, love ..
..and career is fixed ..
.. but ..
Where am I, sir?
Now, I'm right
loneliness, sir.
For a long time, good friend
I own ...
..he was gone.
Myself..
He's not in
myself again.
I'm tale when I'm
lose yourself.
But I do not care
lose someone else, sir.
What's my dream, sir?
I want to go to the border and
save the lives of others.
Not to step
dead body.
But I can not
do it here.
Although there are people fighting
his life in my eyes.
I can not do anything.
First time, I think
angry with yourself.
And it burns you.
Out there, there are people
able to maintain ..
... the carrier because
my words
But why am I this way?
And I do not mind!
I do not want this job.
No sir. I do not want this job
if I can change who I am!
I do not know whether it is correct or
wrong. But this is my self.
My real self!
Now I do not think
my dream, but i ..
.. think how to
get my karektor back.
I'll get it back, sir.
Although I died,
I'm still dead with my character.
Hey soldier.
Why are you here?
You want to
how to go to?
Hey! Hey! Soldiers!
What? What is hey soldier?
Do you want to forget
Can not see the killings in Wizaq ..
Can not see the killings in Wizaq ..
Grandpa, yesterday
there's a question i'm asking
I lied then.
Those who kill.
They killed him
in front of me, in the morning.
I see myself.
I'm sorry, Grandpa.
Very sorry.
I've made a mistake
did not kill you that day.
Kill me today. Kill it.
Kill it!
He is willing to die for
country at age 70.
Nothing wrong with her now.
Kill it. You kill it!
You can hold a knife
now because of freedom ..
.. which is fought by
people like them.
You dare to kill him?
You're weak?
All controlled.
From now on, home and people in it
is under the control of Surya soldier.
Who are you talking about?
The driving youth
car rental?
Is that what you see?
Where is it?
Mom, I want to
eat the same.
Serve it.
Serve it.
He said nothing,
and I can not believe it.
I believe.
You know what will happen
if you hit my man
Not at
.. but I kill.
You do not tell me right?
Kill?
Why?
Because I feel angry.
Why angry?
Anger is not a special quality.
Everyone in the world will be angry.
In India there are 110 billion people.
Everyone was angry.
That's right.
But the anger of 110 billion people
it was felt by a single person. How?
I put salt on it.
But I used to eat
salty and spicy.
Delicious cuisine
I've never been sleeping for a long time.
I want to sleep a second here.
Do not, Challa.
Do not include ego.
Your son is there
in his custody, Challa.
Negotiate with him,
not a fight.
Get up! Get up!
You're enough to sleep.
Why are you?
What do you want?
All this because of Mustapha's land?
Just because of 5 acres of land.
I will stop it.
Including you too.
I will take care of his family.
You help stop this.
Apart from the life of Mustapha,
what else do you want
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I told you everything.
Why is he still silent?
What do you want
India
I want India.
Give it!
You do not understand?
India I have two
different names.
Anwar
You remember, you just kill
Mustapha only one.
But you forgot, murder
the biggest thing you did.
You've got to have a land, and you
has killed India in Anwar.
This is not my homeland.
He wants to be a doctor and
serving in this country ..
.. but he left it.
Where is Anwar now?
What does he do now?
What was the situation he was looking forward to.
What a decision he made.
What was the situation he was looking forward to.
Anyone who knows?
Every criminal who
choose the wrong way ..
.. and make mistakes in the country ..
..and want to destroy the country, I'm as
soldiers were forced to kill them all.
Very bad!
But people like you have been destroyed
country, and what do i want to call you?
Pakistan. Traitor.
Who is the Paksitan?
Who is the Paksitan?
I am an Indian!
What's the proof?
Where is the proof?
Proof yes, proof?
Look at this. Look! Identification card,
ballot cards, bank cards and even passports.
..and I was born in India. Now
I was standing on the ground of India.
India is not what it stores
in the pocket.
But in the heart.
If you live in India,
not necessarily you Indian.
Is India in your heart?
You have 24 hours.
You're looking for Anwar.
Where are you looking for?
 That's all I do not care.
For the first time, your power
will be used for the country.
You hear it here.
If anything happened to Anwar.
Your child will receive the consequences.
Not a traitor,
but the national officer.
Mustapha did not commit suicide,
but he was killed.
Interrupted by death
his father, Anwar ran away from home.
To be responsible for all,
to find Anwar.
I do not care what you have to do,
facebook, whatsapp. Distribute it.
I want the news of Anwar's presence.
The soldier is a man
which protects others ..
..and others are
to protect her child.
Hundreds of people were killed inside
 bomb incident in Delhi. According to official news.
Who is responsible?
in this incident?
What does he do now?
What was the situation he was looking forward to.
What a decision he made.
What was the situation he was looking forward to.
Anyone who knows?
I've been looking around country,
but still no information about Anwar.
Is Anwar not your family all?
The whole country is waiting
you, come back.
You say, this is first
When do you kill people?
Just kills first.
But many times I have seen it.
Who am I to kill?
You..
Anwar is right?
Anwar
Justice will be implemented over
the crime that struck you.
Offenders will be punished.
What are your reactions?
Why do not you say Anwar?
Hello Anwar.
You do not feel happy?
No.
She is not happy.
Justice is upheld.
Helps during the incident,
it is called justice.
But after the devastation took place,
it is called sympathy.
What we do now also
same. Missed consciousness.
You all remember Kapil
Win the dev ..
..cricket fight 30
years ago for India.
But you all do not remember Mustapha
who fought for you all.
People like him
we need to keep in mind ..
.. but we did not keep it
he's even in the brain.
For that, we are not
just lose Mustapha.
But Anwar's conviction
against our country as well.
You're right, Anwar.
I'm with you.
I used to be hotter
like you, Anwar.
I was out of the house at the age of 14 years.
It might have been my journey
such as Abdul Kalam ..
..or bin Osama bin Laden ..
.. and maybe more
people like me now.
Anwar, in life if
 you want to achieve something ..
..you have to choose.
Not because
by your situation.
Because the situation is constantly changing.
But our character is not
should have changed.
Yesterday what's your situation, Anwar?
During the death of your father,
no one comes.
Today.
Thousands came because of you.
It's too late.
It is wrong.
Even slow, but they are
come also, Anwar.
Try to tell me.
In God's command there is only one
light instead of darkness.
Now, if you think
this is not your homeland ..
That's your choice.
Tear it.
Surya passed the exam, Professor. 
He failed.
He can not change his train
and he lost his dreams.
He made everything to realize
 his dream to the border.
And he wants to celebrate.
He saw the passion of love
country of every human being.
Surya is not my son, sir.
But I'm proud of it
will say that he is my son.
The best book I've ever had
read in my life is SURYA.
Tuan.

Hey, you always talk about borders.
How are the conditions at the border?
Borders.
While setting up
feet on the border.
You will be happy no matter
how high it is.
Your eyes will shrink during
watch it.
When your heart shouts the name of the country.
When you arrive at the top
and you look back.
And there you will only see
the effect of your soles.
Besides that..
The music will be heard
first time you hear
When music is a joy of 110 billion inhabitants
heard because you were there.
