'From the time this universe
came into existence.'
'From the time this
mortal world is formed.'
'Since ages the people living
on this earth have believed..
..that desirous snakes
can take any form..
..as and when they want to.'
'When Lord Kishan exterminated
Kaliya in Jamuna then..
..that snake also asked him
for forgiveness in a human form.'
'From those times till date
that story is alive as a reality.'
'From religion the
heart is alive the one..
..who wander follow
only this light.'
Thank you very much, sir.
You saved my life.






It nothing like that
but what are you doing..
..all alone in such
a vast lonely forest?
This must be a forest for you, sir.
But it's just like a
mother to me and also my home.
Home? But.. but here you..
what do you stay alive here on?
To tell you the truth, sir.
On love!
What are you doing in this forest?
Oh, hunting? - No. I have
come here in search of something.
In search?
What are you searching for?
I am writing a book..
on desirous snakes.
On desirous snakes?
You know about them?
I know only as much
as it is written in books.
I haven't seen them
with my own eyes.
I have heard that
after 100 years..






..a snake can take any human form.
Yes. But of the crores of
them there is only one snake..
..who after his life's
100 years of penance only..
..becomes capable
of taking any form.
They are called desirous snakes.
But.. but it must be very difficult
to see or meet them, right?
You saved my life;
I will have to repay this favor.
Tomorrow is a moonless night.
That night desirous snake..
..surely comes to meet
his female desirous snake.
Snake removes his diamond
from his forehead and keeps it out.
His female snake dances
with ecstasy in its shine.
Are you telling the truth? Have
you seen this with you own eyes?
The same way..
..as you are looking at me now.
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
"Even if I have to
leave this world for you."
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
"I will break all the
ties with this world."
"I will never break
the embrace of your arms."
"I will break all the
ties with this world."
"I will never break
the embrace of your arms."
"Even if my life
leaves me and goes."
"Even then I will always
be with you.. be with you."
"The walls of the world
have to be broken down."
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
"Even if I have to
leave this world for you."
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
Say dear, now which one?
- Yellow!
Green! Red!
Anu! Wow!
Look at this doll! You saw?
There is a party at your place,
where were you?
I had gone to bring a present
for you, dear. Look at this.
One more thing is left. - What?
Won't I get anything, dear?
Dad, how did you like my present?
Very.. very sweet, dear.
I felt as if I have got..
..all the happiness of this world!
So much of love for Anu!
Even if her mother was alive, she
wouldn't have loved her so much.
A beautiful pair
of deer is hiding here!
The commutation through signaling
has happened between the eyes.
You have become mine
and I have become yours.
Hi Uday, how are you? - Hi.
Hi, Rajesh. Hi, Rita.
Where is my daughter?
Anu, see what your
uncle has brought for you!
Anu dear,
look what I have brought for you!
A flying car! - Ok say, where
have you left Bhabhi and came?
Where have I left her and come..
..she must be herself sitting
with her Lord Kishan Kanhaiya.
She must be luring her God.
That's enough Uday,
you are jealous of a stone idol!
He is a strong atheist of God.
I have always been an atheist.
But I didn't know that I would
be married to devote like Meerabai.
The vehicle of life
is running in a strange way.
One wheel moves ahead
and the other backwards!
Here is your back wheel!
Greetings!
- Greetings, sister-in-law!
Where is Anu? - Anu.
Yes. Anu!
Anu!
Anu!
Anu! Caroline! Pawan! Anthony!
Have any of you all seen the girl?
She was playing here only.
- She was just playing here only.
What does.. 'She was just playing
here', mean? Go search go.. go!
Hi! - Hi, Ajay!
So this was your prank, right?
Man, it's an old habit!
Hi, Sweetie!
Hello, Raj! - Hi, Uday!
Where were you?
- I will tell you some other time.
Hello. Hi, Kiran. - Hi, man.
Suraj! - Hey!
Suraj, here is your Anu!
- Thank you. Anu!
Man, even if she moves
away from your eyes..
..even for a moment
you almost die.
Won't one die if his breath
is taken away even for a second?
Meena, I came. Look.
How many times have I told you..
..that there is only
one daughter of my brother.
And if you bring a present
for her then bring a nice one.
And what have you brought?
A joker like you!
What! Do I look
like a joker to you?
Then what, are you a hero!
Brother also got me
married to such a person!
Hello, brother.
- Will you both ever ceasefire?
Or will always keep on fighting?
Brother, even at your place there is
always a meeting of your partners,..
..whether it's a child's birthday,
holiday or any day.
Have you seen Bobby (movie)?
- Yes.
You must have seen it alone.
- Yes?
Watch it with me you will
have a different kind of fun!
Uncle, even I will come.
- Where will you go?
This movie is not for kids,
go from here!
Take her also.
- What are you saying!
You wait outside I will meet
you outside after the cake is cut.
Done!
Happy birthday, dear Anu.
Happy birthday to you.
He is a jolly good fellow!
He is a jolly good fellow!
He is a jolly good fellow!
- Happy birthday, Anu!
Hi, everybody!
Hi. - Say thank you to aunty!
Say thank you to aunty!
And yes!
This letter has been sent..
..by your friend for all of you.
Ok so our friend
is no one of yours?
He is, he surely is,
but he still isn't as yet.
This means that..
..we will have to leave right now,
at this very moment.
Listen!
You made a mistake of
taking birth 5000 years late!
If you had been born in yester
years then you would be valued for.
Hey, why are you all laughing?
We are not laughing
my friend we are crying.
On your brains and our stupidity!
One crazy had a dream in the
jungle and to investigate that..
..we all crazy people
came to his place.
This is not craziness
it's the truth.
I have seen with my own eyes
those two humans turn into snakes.
Vijay, first we had doubt
only on your brains but..
..now it seems that even
your eyes are giving up!
How can we believe that
a snake whenever he wishes..
..can take a human
form and whenever..
..he wants again
turn into a snake!
I would say that this
is just a piece of your..
..imagination and nothing else!
I feel like laughing
even while thinking about it!
Few years back people like
you used to laugh just like this..
..on the one who used
to talk about going to the moon.
Philosopher sir,
you cannot change..
..the truth into false
with your philosophy.
Oh brother, these, desirous
snakes are here since ages.
And the thing which
has been true..
..since ages is true even today!
Do you understand that?
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
"Even if I have to
leave this world for you."
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
"Even if I have to
leave this world for you."
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
"On my forehand the dew
has filled in the pearls."
"And the scenery
has applied the henna."
"On my forehand the dew

"And the scenery

"Even without dance,
the anklets are chiming!"
"Even without the breeze, the veil

"Today the heart has
to be united with the heart!"
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
"I becoming an eye

..you become such
a photograph of love!"
"I becoming an eye
keep looking at you..
..you become such
a photograph of love!"
"I always be in the shadow
of your arms embrace..
..you become such a destiny
of my breaths.. become a destiny."
"The promise which I have
made to you I won't break it."
"I will never break my

Who shot? - I did.
Why?
If I wouldn't shoot then the
snake would have bitten that girl!
That is not a girl, stupid.
She is a snake.
And the snake that you shot,
I have seen him in human form.
I have spoken to him.
- But now what should I do?
A bullet once shot
cannot be taken back.
The way a bullet shot from
a gun cannot be taken back..
..the same way a snake's
revenge cannot be deferred!
It is said that in the eyes
of a dying snake..
..his killer's face is set.
And the snake's mate
doesn't rest till..
..she doesn't take
the revenge of the murder.
So now what should we do?
There is only one
chance to save Kiran.
We should immediately
find that snake..
..and bury him in
the ground so that..
..his mate cannot see
his face in his eyes!
Yes, come on. - Yes!
No! What happened!
It's hurting a lot?
The hurt is not of dying
but of being separated from you.
We have.. waited a thousand
nights.. for this night!
Our.. marriage night..
but.. these tormentors..
..have made our..
night of uniting..
Such night..
..which doesn't have a morning.
No! You cannot leave me and go!
I have the oath of your love,..
..I will take revenge of
your death from each one of them.
And of my widowhood!
Oh no! What's wrong with you all?
You all are so quiet
as if sitting in a graveyard!
Why are you not getting serious,
Kiran? You think that..
I understand.
I have shot the bullet.
If there is anyone's face set
in snake's eyes then it is mine!
And if according to
your rubbish theory..
..if the snake's
mate will take revenge..
..then she will take it
from me why are you all worried?
Kiran, why do you think
yourself different from us?
Oh no! You all stop worrying
about me and go to sleep.
We have to go on a long trip
tomorrow morning. Good night!
You?
So you came!
Yes sir,
where could I go without you?
There is one more place..
where I can send you.
The same place where
I send your snake!
Sir, the life saved
by you is on your feet.
Till today that snake
had trapped me in his charms.
You only have freed me!
Now if you want then
you can even take my life.
Then I will have no sorrow.
The only sorrow is that..
..you have made a
mistake in recognizing me.
What do you mean? - I
am a snake charmer by profession.
We daily charm snakes.
But I don't know how
that snake charmed me?
I have been freed after ages.
And I today by myself had
come to present myself to you.
From today you are
not my owner but my God!
So this is it.
Your place is not there it's here.
What happened?
- When you touched me there..
..there was a strange
sensation in my body.
May be because I have
been in a snake's embrace.
Don't get scared a human
is not as dangerous as a snake.
Leave at dawn. - Yes?
Come.
Why are you closing the door, sir?
We humans even love secretly.
Yes sir, whenever a desirous
snake comes in front of a mirror..
..then the one who is looking
will see it in it's true form.
But you will not stay alive
to tell this secret to you friends.
What are you searching for?
Pistol? Here it is!
But I'll not kill you with a pistol
I will kill you with my poison.
Raj! Raj, he was saying that
we have to go on a long journey..
..come lets call him, the car
is ready. - Ok, we will call him.
What happened?
He is not opening the door.
- What?
Kiran! It's me, Kiran!
Kiran! - Kiran!
Break it!
You were right, Vijay.
The snake took her revenge.
Yes Rajesh,
there has been a lot of felony.
There has been a lot of felony.
What happened? - The snake!
She was just sitting on
my chest and was going to bite me.
Where has she gone? - Neither
had she come nor has she gone.
It's just your illusion.
It's a story which your fear
made up and your mind accepted it.
No Rita, you don't know.
In the eyes of a dying snake
the face of his killer is set.
After seeing which his
mate starts taking revenge.
Great! As if it's not
snakes eye and it's a camera!
Snakes eyes are camera.
There is a camera in snake's eyes.
Who is he, mother? - Who am I?
Can't you see my get
up and say who am I?
I am a snake charmer.
And you think that when I was
born this flute was in my mouth.
From that time the tunes
I have started playing, sir..
..do you know how famous it is?
From America to Africa!
Sir, from Nigeria to Malaria!
From Asia to Malaysia!
That is all over the world!
Now you understood!
You talk too much!
- I talk too much!
Sir, my father died with
this sorrow that I talk too less.
That's why I am called
'Ghunga Bhopali'. Yes!
Hey, do the work for
which you have come here.
Now I am playing the flute,
now you understand.
Ok you are acting smart with me!
You are showing me your tongue!
Come on!
This looks like the same snake.
- It's the same snake.
Look at its face and recognize it!
It's the same.
Ma'am, your son is very lucky!
Now you understand..
..this is a very dangerous animal.
It's memory is stronger
than the devil and..
..it's speed is faster
than death. Yes!
Now you won't say that
it was my illusion, right?
How can such a big
snake come in an illusion?
Come on.. come on first
remove the snake out of the house.
Come. - That I will remove it.
It's very long. It's very long!
Now all your doubts are cleared?
Only ten! You think that's
only for the rent of the flute.
Take ten more then
don't ask for any more!
You keep this ten keep it.. keep
it.. and give this hundred only.
Only a bigger size will do,
it was a big snake!
Come we will ask mother.
- You don't need to ask me, dear.
You have as much right
over Rajesh as much as I have.
What to do? Now the
time is not very auspicious.
I am waiting for an auspicious
time to get you both married.
Now come on,..
..if it is afternoon
by the time we leave..
..then what's the use of
going out?
Hey, you are still standing here?
Go.. go inside and dry yourself.
And wear the hotel's gown..
or else you will catch cold. - Ok.
Yes, operator.
Yes, get me 365757 please.
Yes mother, it's Rajesh.
Mother, it's raining
quite heavy.. here.
Rajesh, why are you
not saying anything?
Yes. Yes, we both..
Rita and I have been stuck here.
Son, but where are you calling
from? - From Sun and Sand.
Why don't you say anything?
Look, he hung up!
Today I feel like..
..to gather all the storms
in the world.. in my arms.
Before marriage?
But your mother says..
..that nowadays inauspicious
time is going on.
Tonight..
..all the stars are invisible.
And so then..
..even we..
Greetings, mother.
- Bless you, dear!
Where is Rajesh?
How would I know I have
come to meet him only?
Are you kidding me?
First you go out with him.
Then you come back
and ask me where is he?
I haven't even seen Rajesh.
Dear, I am not blind
that I cannot..
..recognize my would
be daughter-in-law.
I had gone out from 4
days I came back just today.
Then who was she?
- You must be surely mistaken.
But.. but how is this possible?
- It is possible, aunty.
Everything is possible. She
can take any form to take revenge.
Who? - That snake!
Hello.
Please give the call to Rajesh.
Sorry, wrong number.
Hello.. hello.
Who was it? - Your friend Vijay.
He was trying to come between us.
I ignored him.
You did a good thing.
Wait!
Ok! So you both are
hiding here and romancing!
And we all are waiting
for you both..
..for the dance competition
downstairs!
It was good that Pinky
saw you both coming here.
Or else we would keep on
searching for you both. - Yes.
But.. - Oh shut up!
No ifs or buts. Come on.
There is no fun in the dance
competition without you both.
But how can we participate,
our clothes have still not come.
Why do you worrying
about the clothes?
They will come, you come on.
- Come.
Aunty, we should immediately
leave for Sun and Sand.
What if Rajesh becomes
a victim of that snake?
"Hey!"
"Yours mine, mine yours.
Mine yours, yours mine..
"..the heart has
united with the heart."
"Tell this to all gathered here."
"The heart has united
with the heart."
"Tell this to all gathered here."
"Yours mine, mine yours.
Mine yours, yours mine..
"..have got eyes on
each other with difficult."
"Tell this to all gathered here."
"Have got eyes on each
other with difficult."
"Tell this to all gathered here."
"Yours mine. - Mine yours."
"Yours mine. - Mine yours."
"Mine yours. - Yours mine."
"The heart has united
with the heart."
"Tell this to all gathered here."
"Have got eyes on each
other with difficult."
"Tell this to all gathered here."
"I wish that..
we go far away.. from this world."
"I wish that..
we go far away.. from this world."
"We sit alone and show each
other the pain in our hearts."
"I have thought of your
heart pain as of my own."
"What the hurry,
this is our first step in love."
"There is love and
the lover also here.."
"..such a night rarely comes.
Tell this to all gathered here."
"Such a night rarely comes.
Tell this to all gathered here."
"Yours mine. - Mine yours."
"Mine yours. - Yours mine."
"The heart has united
with the heart."
"Tell this to all gathered here."
"Have got eyes on each
other with difficult."
"Tell this to all gathered here."
"This party is colorful.
It's a fair of beautiful people."
"This party is colorful.
It's a fair of beautiful people."
"All those who have a heart
they won't be able to stay alone!"
"All those who want to meet, meet."
"There will be no
such meeting again."
"Fix things up while talking,
these talks will not happen again."
"Oh my beloved,
I swear on your life.."
"..now we are not far
away from our destination."
"Tell this to all gathered here."
"Now we are not far
away from our destination."
"Tell this to all gathered here."
"Yours mine, mine yours.
Mine yours, yours mine..
..the heart has
united with the heart."
"Tell this to all gathered here."
"The heart has united
with the heart."
"Tell this to all gathered here."
"Yours mine, mine yours.
Mine yours, yours mine..
..the heart has
united with the heart."
"Tell this to all gathered here."
"The heart has united
with the heart."
"Tell this to all gathered here."
Hey, why are you
going under the bed?
So come and take me..
where I belong to.
You are getting intoxicated,
right?
Now you will know that
a snake intoxication..
..is greater than alcohol
and a woman's intoxication!
Your body is getting cold,..
..but inside me there
is a fire of revenge burning!
You.. you broke up our pair!
I broke your pair!
Aunty, come fast!
Rajesh! My son!
My soul!
Even you left me and went, son!
Mother!
- Even you left me and went!
Mother!
Oh God!
What kind of injustice is this!
What kind of injustice is this!
'What are you looking in my eyes?'
'I can see two sparks
shining in your eyes today.'
'Two flames are igniting.
- Think that today..
..the thirst of ages from its
own doing has turned into fire.'
'I am like that bee who is since
ages roaming around one same rose.'
'But.. till now couldn't
have it's drink!'
'No.. no. Not today. - Then when?'
'Who knows about life?
- No.. no!'
You will do as I say.
I have told you
about company's share.
Now it's your work
to make the documents.
But remember one thing; this
secret should remain between us.
First Kiran and now Rajesh.
It looks as if..
..all our faces were
set in that snake's eyes.
Who knows which one of us is next?
Vijay, the story which
you have started..
..who knows what will be its end?
I will only say that
we should do something..
..to protect ourselves
from that snake's attack.
But what can we do?
I know a person who
can save us from this snake.
Who is he?
- There is one.. a saint, a sage.
By killing that snake you
all have invited your death.
The black line which the
snake has drawn of revenge..
..that doesn't end
at one place or one house.
It reaches to all your door steps.
- To erase that black line only..
..we have come under
your protection, Baba.
It's the question
of our lives, Baba.
Baba, I am not
worried about my life.
But if something
happens to me then..
..what will happen
to my motherless daughter?
Human can forget to take
revenge but not a snake!
I am helpless. - Baba, please
don't let us go empty handed.
Your charms are very powerful.
And if we get your blessings
then that snake won't dare.
To save a human life is the biggest
good deed in the world, Baba.
The biggest good
deed in the world!
It's all in the hands
of the God I am just a beggar.
I am his follower.
I pray to his Om charms.
Which I am giving this
to you all for your protection.
This is the fruit of my penance,
keep it carefully.
Think of this as a reimbursement.
And keep this on your neck.
Till this is in your neck
the snake forget killing..
..she won't even be
able to touch you, dear.
Keep this Om and all with you,
Baba. I am not scared of death.
The one who makes this world run..
..is not your God but we humans.
There is no power stronger
than humans, Baba.
If human is the
biggest power then..
..why couldn't you save
your friends from dying?
You are not the first and the
last atheist of God in this world.
And to make an atheist, a believer
is a very easy task for God.
These charms and all things,
tell them to those..
..who have their brains
locked with the fear of that snake.
I believe in only what I see.
- Ok then. Bhopali!
Hail Mother Kali!
You saw,
the snake did not return..
..think that your
death returned back.
Atheist, now do you
believe that there is God?
Who is greater than me,
greater than you..
..and greater than everyone of us.
Hey, what is this
that I am seeing!
You and bowing in
front of Lord Shankar..
..and have the protection
of Om on your neck!
Yes Sheela, because today
a atheist has become a believer.
I now know that from
so long I have done..
..so much of injustice
to you, Sheela.
I got married to you.
But I didn't give
you a happy married life.
Can I say something? - Tell.
Sheela, I want you to wear
the same wedding dress today.
And we both prisoners..
..again should become
like two companions.
Say, do you agree?
- It seems like the moon asking..
..the moonless night that would
you like to be a full moon night?
Please close the hook.
Who is it?
A telegram for you.
Whose telegram is it?
- From your house.
Your brother is seriously ill.
- Kailash brother!
I will have to leave immediately!
I would surely come with you..
..but what to do
tomorrow morning there is..
..a meeting of board of directors.
I know but please
take care of yourself.
The car also had to
get punctured now only!
Now what will happen?
- This will take time.
I fear that you
might miss your train.
One cannot even see a taxi nearby.
Hey, Vijay brother!
- Again a puncture!
How many times have I
told you to change this tyre?
But you will not listen
- We will do that tomorrow.
But today Sheela has to
catch a train from the station.
I will drop bhabhi. But bhabhi,
all this all of a sudden?
Brother is seriously ill.
- Be quick it's already 10 o'clock.
Come on.
Leave me! Help!
Leave me!
I said leave me! Leave me!
Help! Help! Leave me!
Leave me! Leave me!
Help!
Leave me!
No!
Rascals ran away!
Come I will drop you.
- No, don't want to go back there.
Tomorrow morning I will get a train
and I will return to my village.
And in the middle
there is a question..
..of one night that
will be spent anyhow.
What if those goons
come back again then?
That is the only thing I fear.
- Come with me.
There is no need for you to spend
a night like this on the road.
Come.
The man from whom you saved me.
He did a fake marriage with
me and brought me to the city.
When I came here
I came to know that..
..he doesn't want to keep
me as his wife but as a guest room.
Where one night
one traveler stays..
..and the other night, another.
Listen, you are drenched.
You go in that room..
..open the cupboard
and change your clothes.
I think you have
caught a little cold.
If you don't mind should I bring..
a little brandy?
Drink it thinking
of it as a medicine.
Take this.
Why do we need another glass?
Do you mind?
No, why would I mind?
What kind of nonsense is this?
Look at the wall, here.
Brandy and that
also of blue color!
Not of brandy,
poison is blue in color.
Because the one with
whom you were drinking..
..she wasn't a
woman she was a snake.
Look, over there!
It was better that you had
that blessed chain in your neck..
..that's why she couldn't
directly attack you.
But how did you reach here?
Bhabhi by mistake had
taken the house keys with her.
Take this and be careful.
Just think that
her penance saved her.
Oh Lord Shiva! Oh Lord Shiva!
Who are you? - A widow.
Whose husband was killed by 6 men.
I have come to fight with you.
- With me, why?
You gave them the protection
of Om! - I understood!
And also understand
this that whoever..
..comes in my way
I will kill them also.
The thirst of taking
revenge has made you crazy!
Only God has the right
to give life and to take it.
Neither does a human have
a right nor does a snake!
Then who gave them
the right to kill my love!
Why did they kill my lover?
What did he do wrong for them?
I won't spare even
a single one alive.
Stupid, your own poison
is poisoning your head!
You are making a big mistake!
To play with the life given
by God is a crime. A crime!
You keep the accounts of God
and bad deeds to yourself, Baba.
If you have taken up the
responsibility of their safety..
..then even I have taken an oath.
I will kill each one of them.
- Stupid!
By becoming a barrier
which is protected by air.
What will that flame extinguish
which has been lightened by God!
I will also make you
change your decision.
Truth always wins!
And so does the faith!
Ok so now you have taken
the form of my disciple!
Taken the form of?
I am your disciple!
"My heart swings my body swings."
"The peace of my heart is gone;
who is this playing the flute!"
My heart.. sir, I was having fun,
why did you stop?
Hey donkey, where is that snake?
Get up!
If you all fight after this..
..then I will break
all your skulls!
Do you all understand!
Leave me! - Do you want to die?
Yes.. yes I want to die!
When the life is over
and still one has to life..
..then what can I woman do?
- What happened in your life?
What should I tell to a
passer by about my sad story?
Let me die, brother! - Brother!
You called me brother?
Tell me what's wrong?
- My husband has brought..
..a prostitute as his
second wife to my house.
And threw me out of the house.
Is the second wife more
beautiful then you are?
She is not at all beautiful
but she is a conjurer!
Brother, she has put a blessed
chain on my husband's neck.
First only his way
of looking had changed..
..but after wearing the blessed
chain his heart has only changed!
Brother, now he even
doesn't want to see my face!
You come with me. I will send
that woman to her rightful place!
And will tell your husband
that a married woman is a Goddess.
And not a slipper
which can be worn..
..whenever liked whenever
wished throw it out!
And if he still
doesn't understand..
..then I know how to
use my formula. Come on!
How did this happen?
How did you leave a snake
that came to you, Baba?
I didn't leave her, she left.
Like however hard a person tries..
..life slips out of the body!
People say that after drinking..
..human blood the snake's
fins get as sharp as swords!
What people say is right.
But the protection of Om..
..which I have given
you that is such a shield..
..which cannot be
harmed by any sword!
Let the snake come as
a storm or a storm of death..
..she will have to calm
down and she will return back.
Now you alert your friends
that the Om's protection..
..which I have given them
they should not remove it..
..from their body at any cost.
When I reached there,
brother was fine.
But who gave this
false telegram and why?
That day was 1st April, someone
must have made an April fool of us.
Wow! Wow!
Wow! It's great! What luxury!
What is your name? - Name!
You will know that also!
I will stamp on the
envelope such that no one..
..will have any trouble reading
the address of the post office.
That is strange goon!
I am asking you how you came here.
To see the respect
of the respected!
I saw!
What nonsense are you speaking of?
Stare like this to someone else.
Or else I will remove..
..these eyes which are like buttons
and stitch them to my shirt!
I have seen many respected
people like you..
..how they remove their
wives from their house..
..and bring home the dirt of the
market to entertain themselves!
This is my wife!
- Then who is she!
She is a snake! - Listen brother,
now I am a snake for him.
Yes.. yes you are a snake!
I know her very well, Sheela.
First also she has played
with the life of my two friends!
But now I will end
her game forever!
You respected people are strange!
To make a prostitute happy
you can make your wife a snake!
Who is a prostitute I am his wife!
This Mangalsutra is
the memento of our wedding.
Even I have a
Mangalsutra in my neck.
Which he himself wore to me.
- Very good!
You even buy something
as pure as..
..Mangalsutra by the
dozen in the market!
I cannot speak in a
street language like you!
When we respected people
get married there are rituals..
..performed,
there are witnesses and evidences!
What evidence do you have of this?
Evidence! I will just bring them!
Look at this!
I have seen it now
even you have a look.
How did this happen?
How did the photograph change?
How did the photographs change!
The photographs haven't
changed he has changed!
This female has
put a spell on him!
Till he has this blessed
chain in his neck even if..
..he tries to recognize he won't
be able to recognize his wife!
You move aside..
..I will make arrangement
for this blessed chain!
No!
I am ruined, brother!
I am ruined!
This devil took your friend away
from you and my husband from me!
"By becoming the
voice of your breath.."
"..I steal the softness
of your lips away."
"By becoming the
voice of your breath.."
"..I steal the softness
of your lips away."
"With the smooth
fire of your beauty.."
"..I want to burn my heart
with it.. burn my heart with it "
"By joining this relationship
once I don't want to break it."
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
"Even if I have to
leave this world for you."
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
"Even if I have to
leave this world for you."
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
No lawyer sir, I don't
want to tell anyone anything.
And neither do I
think it is important.
I am the managing
director of this company.
All that is fine
but have you thought..
..that what will
be the outcome of this!
Whatever might be the outcome
no blame will come on you!
All its responsibility is mine.
- Mr. Raj.
Oh Raj, you!
Raj, you must have
heard about Uday.
I have heard.
But I think you haven't
heard this news.
What? - That snake is caught!
Snake is caught!
Very good! Let's celebrate, Raj!
Raj! Raj!
Yes, sir. - I am going out.
Take care of the snake
she is very dangerous.
She is very dangerous!
You don't worry, sir..
..I will keep her
tight within my hands.
She is very dangerous!
We will see!
With the blessing of
my mentor saint Rathanath..
..and saint Fathe
Shahgaze prayers..
..I have captured your
death closed it in a box.
Think that the snake
is forever in captivity..
..and you all free forever.
But Baba, till the
time that snake is alive..
..our freedom is
like that of a prisoner..
..who has been sentenced
to death but is not hanged.
Baba, why don't you
do one thing? - What?
You sell us that snake.
What will you do after
buying the snake, sir?
We will kill her. - And you want
that I should help you in that?
Why not! We are ready
to pay whatever you ask for.
What can be the price
of any ordinary snake!
We will pay you Rs.10,000.
I didn't know that
your lives are so cheap!
Ok Baba, then take Rs.50,000.
Forget 50,000 I don't
want even 50 lakhs!
We saints worship snakes and protect
them. We don't do their business!
He sitting up there..
..in the heaven who runs the
factory of sky, earth and hell..
..He has given every creature equal
entitlement and right to live!
But Baba, that snake
has killed our 3 friends!
But you all were the
first one to attack!
But think this, Baba. A cost
of one snake is 3 human lives!
Animals don't have brains like
humans! They only have a heart.
And the accounts of heart
is not as that of a grocer.
For them one plus two
doesn't equal to three!
All though only one
might have attacked..
..but for her you
all are the killers!
You! You! And you all!
What happened, dad?
Dear, I have seen a scary dream.
And if what I saw
would have happened..
..then what would
happen to you, dear?
What? - Nothing, you go to sleep.
Go to sleep!
In this world dreams
can and cannot come true.
But a dream of a snake!
A dream of a snake will never
every be untrue! It can never!
Then what should we do?
If there no cause,
there won't be any trouble!
You take away the
snake's box itself!
How will you take it away? This
work cannot be done without me!
Now you understand it!
That's why you have
been called here.
And I came.
I came! Baba only worships snakes.
But I also worship the money!
And money cannot be worship
if you won't have it!
I will not ask for 50,000,
only give me 20,000. 20,000!
Cost of one snake is Rs. 20,000!
This is neither the cost of
the snake nor of the snake charmer.
Think as if you are
insuring lives of 3 people!
And cost of one person
only Rs.6666.66!
You are getting it very cheap!
Take it!
Do you all accept it or not?
Ok we accept it! - Ok then
even the danger is also far away!
Vijay, he came! - Give it to me!
No, first show me the money!
Ok. - Yes!
Take this 20,000. - Yes!
Be careful she is very dangerous!
She is very restless!
- You leave!
I am leaving.
- You run away from here.
I am running!
Suraj, take this
box and keep it there.
I will shoot her with a bullet!
Ready?
Ready! - Wait!
I will shoot. - Why do
you have a doubt on my aim?
We have been seeing your
aim from long, now you see my aim!
Whoever of you two
want to shoot, shoot!
If you both want to fight then
give me the pistol, I will shoot.
Suraj, I will shoot!
You move aside, Suraj!
The story of this
snake has ended forever!
I married you and gave
you so much admiration..
..but you have started
dancing in clubs!
Wonderful! I just pointed
out to you, and you..
You have offended me completely!
Now.. now I cannot stay
in this house for even a minute!
Who the hell has
asked you to stay?
Now I find only one solution
to this question. Divorce!
Divorce!
I am shocked to hear a daunting
word like divorce from you.
But what else can I do?
Your sister has made
my life like hell!
The relationship of a
husband and wife is very..
..strong which cannot
be broken by anybody.
And sometimes it becomes
as delicate as a flower..
..which withers
even in a little heat.
Sir, it's very easy
to destroy a family..
..but it's very
difficult to make it.
You are talking as if
I am destroying the family!
Your sister is
destroying the family.
Instead of holding
me responsible..
..why don't you explain
to your sister?
I will definitely explain to her.
I will tell her that marriage
is like a bird's nest..
..which is made by 2 people,
husband and wife.
One gathers the grass..
- And the other scatters it!
So when will the nest be made?
And even if it is made,
then for how long will it exist?
What will be its condition?
Give me another chance.
If she comes to you,
then give me a call tomorrow.
And if she comes to me,
then I will pull..
..her by her ears and
bring her to your house.
Hello brother!
Did you fight with
your husband again?
Today the fight is over!
Let him be happy in his house.
I have come to my house.
Your house is the one
which you have left behind.
New house is like a hotel
for a girl, where a person..
..can rest for a night,
but cannot stay there forever.
If today my mother was alive,
she would embrace..
..me and tell me that Meena,
you did the..
..right thing
by leaving that jail.
Mother would have never said that!
She would catch you
by your hair and take..
..you to the place which
you are calling jail!
So today fulfil this wish of yours,
brother!
Catch your sister by her hair
and throw her out of the house!
Meena, how should
I explain to you?
Marriage is like a punishment..
..in which a person
has to sacrifice his..
..antagonism in
order to gain happiness.
And you have a lot
of antagonism in you.
If you don't want to
keep your sister with you..
..then don't keep,
but at least don't hurt..
..her more by giving
such lectures!
Meena!
Remember what mother used to say?
She used to say that
an ideal woman is the one..
..who gets married
from her father's house..
..and dies in her husband's house.
Suraj is quite tense nowadays.
Your fight has made him tenser.
If possible,
instead of giving him pain..
..try to keep him happy.
Come, I'll drop you home.
I'll come, but I'll meet Anu first.
Or don't I have this right also?
You have thousands
of rights in this house.
And you have one
right on my life also.
Never forget that!
No, I will never forget.
I am ashamed of myself,
Vijay brother.
What brother did for me,
and what I did to him?
Meena!
Hello. Brother! Meena is with me.
How can Meena be over there?
Meena is here.
She might be someone else.
Then who is this?
Suraj! Suraj!
Who is it?
I am the snake which
you people had killed.
If you want your daughter
to be alive, then come upstairs.
Remove the locket which
you have worn and throw it out..
..otherwise your daughter's
life is in danger.
Dad! Dad!
Dad! Dad!
Dad!
If you want your daughter
to be alive, then remove..
..the locket which you
have worn and throw it out!
Dad! Dad! Dad!
Suraj! Suraj!
Vijay.. that snake..
took revenge and.. went away.
She wanted to kill..
one of the 2 lives.
I gave my life..
and saved my life.
I am bestowing this upon you,
my friend.
This is my final memento.
Now she is in your hands.
Please take care of her, Vijay!
I promise you,
Vijay, I will consider your..
..daughter as the most
precious thing in my life.
Suraj!
Brother!
"I won't stop loving you."
"I won't stop loving you."
"Even if I have to
leave the world for you."
"I won't stop loving you."
"I won't stop loving you."
I am not going to
die with these toys!
You have even tried
to kill me and burn me.
But how did you come alive?
You were dead.
Men are of 2 kinds,
one who are born fools..
..and the others
who are made fools.
The disciple of the snake baba
is the fool of the first kind..
..and you are of the second kind!
I fooled him and escaped.
..and I was not the
one that you people had burnt.
It was someone else.
But now you are dead.
Not I, but you are dead.
Now even if you build
a steel wall in front of you..
..I won't spare you.
Now it's your turn!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you before you kill me.
What is this?
First I was trying to make
the snake as my bullet's target..
..but good that the snake's
mate has come out himself.
Raj!
Sometimes the snake takes
the form of a human being..
..to kill her enemy,
but a snake in your form..
..has never come into this world.
What do you mean?
I mean you are more
bothered about your..
..friend's fortune,
rather than his life.
I have now realized
what your real plan is.
Which plan?
The plan that you were
making from the beginning.
You transferred all the shares..
..in your name with
the help of that lawyer.
Raj!
Raj! Raj!
Come to your senses, Raj!
Come to your senses!
I'll tell you what
the truth is today!
Come with me! Come!
Take this, and read it.
I don't even want to look at it.
I am willing to die with that
snake's poison, but I am not..
..willing to read the evidence
of my friend's unfaithfulness!
No Raj! You have to read it!
Take it, and read!
Vijay, what did you do?
You gave your share
to the others..
..in which even a scoundrel
like me is included!
Raj, if I could,
I would not take..
..my friends'wealth,
but their death.
Please forgive me, Vijay.
I made a very big mistake.
Forget it.
Forget whatever happened.
Shake hands!
Ok Vijay, I'm making a move.
- Where are you going?
To search that snake.
Listen friend, we'll live
together and die together also.
I'll come with you.
- No Vijay, this work is mine.
She has invited just me.
And even I have decided,
my friend, that I will kill her.
No, Raj!
No! I won't let you go alone!
Take my promise, Vijay,
you will have to let me go alone.
This is my work,
and I have to do it on my own.
How bad one feels when
one's friendship breaks.
And how happy one feels
when it joins again, isn't it?
Snakes of India!
Are you Mr. Raj Kumar? - Yes.
And my name is Rajkumari.
I was waiting for you.
Very interesting! How did you know
that I am coming from London today?
I neither called you up,
nor did I write any letter to you.
The connections of
the heart are such that..
..one gets the news
even when not sent.
Great!
Then you might be also knowing..
..why I have come over here.
Yes, you have to take a very
important decision of your life,..
..and I am ready for it.
This is so strange!
What I had thought..
..and what has happened!
Nothing has happened until now.
You have just stepped
into the house now.
I had thought that it would
be very boring meeting you.
There might be some fool who my
mother wants me to get married to,..
..but it'll be.. - Correct.
Yes, it'll be great
fun if we two meet.
Sit.
Don't you offer your guests?
You are drinking alone and
you didn't ask for water also.
What will you drink?
What are you drinking?
It's like cold drink,
but stronger that cold drink.
Will you be able to handle it?
Even poison does not affect me.
I know.
Cheers for your health!
May God give you a long life!
Why are you laughing?
I thought of a poem.
Damsels like you have
killed problems and long lives.
Are you reading
something in my eyes?
Yes, I am reading what a long
life destiny has written for me.
Then let's play the music!
I get wings when the
music starts playing!
I start flying!
My friends say that I start
dancing like a snake at that time.
You should dance.
Even you have the
same energy and vigour.
You and I make a good pair.
Even I feel the same as you do..
..that there is nothing
as beautiful as a snake.
And what do you think about
the poison that a snake has?
Even human beings are not
less in the matter of poison.
You must have heard
a philosopher's saying..
..that only that person
can enjoy each day of his life..
..who considers each
day as his last day.
Have a drink on
this thought, and..
..consider this as
the last drink of life.
Why did you play this
stupid music of the flute..
..instead of such a nice music?
Because on the music of a flute,
a snake dances in..
..such a way, like lightning
dances in the raining clouds.
I'll not dance!
You have to dance!
You have to dance..
..on this music
and bop like a snake.
Raj! Have you gone mad?
If the bullet would have touched
her you would have been in jail!
There is no such law
in the world which..
..punishes the person
who kills a snake.
Snake! Where is the snake?
She is the snake.
She! Snake!
Stupid!
You are not in your senses!
That's why every girl
looks like a snake to you.
So you thought I am a snake.
That's why you played
the flute music.
Yes.
Vijay, good you came on time,
otherwise..
..I wonder what would happen.
And maybe the happiness
of our lives..
..which were going to begin,
would come to an end.
What is this secret?
I'll tell you.
Our families have decided
to get both of us married.
That's wonderful!
Take this, wear this life-chain
to him with your hands.
Thank you, Vijay.
Ok, I'll make a move.
But you have to
take a drink with us.
Not today, I don't want
to disturb you both today.
Bye!
Bye Vijay!
See you!
Sorry, do you have a first aid?
Take it easy. Bye!
I'm sorry, all this
has happened because of me.
It's all right.
"Your and my love is not
from years, but from decades."
"Your and my love."
"Your and my love."
"Not any village or town,
but the.."
"..whole world taunts
your and my love."

"Your and my love."
"Not weeks,

"Your and my love."
"Your and my love."
"Ask the kohl of your eyes,

"Ask the kohl of your eyes,

"..and ask the
shade of your hair."
"Ask your style,
ask your fair arms.."
"..and ask your sharp eyes.
- What?"
"I have got you in
every birth of mine."
"So many generations have passed."
"Your and my love."
"Your and my love."
"The black clouds,

"..and the aromatic
air have seen it."
"The black clouds,

"..and the aromatic
air have seen it."
"The moon, the deep darkness.."
"..and the rising sun have seen it.

"All have known

"Your and my love."
"Your and my love."
"Your and my love."
Raju, come soon.
What is it?
I'll tell you when you come here.
I'm coming.
What happened?
I slipped!
- Should I come inside?
No! There is no need!
Did you get hurt?
No.
Should I see? - No!
How can I let you touch my feet?
Not legs, but I can at least
take your body into my arms.
You have changed
so much in so less time.
What is wrong with you suddenly?
I am not made of rock.
When your heart beats
close to my heart..
..it seems as if
my body Is burning.
Then why are you refusing?
Because that what
you want cannot..
..happen before marriage.
I am ready to marry
you today itself, right now.
Right now? - Yes.
You are forgetting in
the intoxication of love..
..that the holy rituals
are read in marriage..
..because fire is another
form of God, like this locket..
..of yours is like
another form of God.
Ok, so I'll consider
this locket as another..
..form of God and
keep it in the middle.
And we'll take the
auspicious circles around it.
Om is the head of all the prayers.
The world had started
off with Om..
..and will finish
off in the name of Om.
If, for a minute,
we consider this day as..
..the last day of your life,
then what will you do?
I will hug life and say
that I always loved you..
..and I love you even today.
And if you come to know
that the person who is in your..
..arms, is not life,
but death, then what will you do?
Then I will hug death.
And I will keep my head
on her shoulders and tell..
..her that I want to
sleep in the shade of her hair.
Why will the person,
who gets such a beautiful death,..
..want to live?
Really?
Really.
Your face..
looks.. a little foggy.
The light in your
eyes has become dim.
Why?
This is what happens
in love and death.
Is this love.. or death?
Your death,
and the rage of my love..
..which you all had
turned into a widow one day.
Raj!
Raj! What has happened to you?
Snake!
Raj! Raj!
Raj, I won't let you die,
Raj! Raj!
Raj, I won't let you die,
Raj! Raj!
Raj! Raj!
Raj!
No, Sunita! No!
After Suraj's death, Anu is not his
daughter, but she is my daughter.
And he is just
anxious about what..
..will happen to that
small child after me.
Anu is not only your daughter,
but she is my daughter too.
We both will take care
of her together, Vijay.
But.. but Sunita,
talking about marriage for me is..
..like talking of spending
life in the valley of death.
Nothing can remain alive
in the presence of that snake.
But there's one thing
that can remain alive.
Love. I love you, Vijay.
Sunita,
for the sake of this love..
..I don't want you to
live like a widow all your life.
May you become a bride,
but not of..
..that person who
may die at any moment.
Vijay, my love won't let you die.
You might be having a lot
of power like Goddess Savitri,..
..Sunita, but I don't
have another birth like Shravan.
How can I agree to make you a..
..widow before
making you my bride?
Then listen to my decision also,
Vijay..
..I am ready to
become your widow..
..but I am not ready to
become somebody else's wife!
But I don't agree
to your decision at all!
Not at any cost!
I am very sure that
the vermilion of..
..a wife can challenge
the poison of any snake.
Sunita, your faith is so strong,
so great, that I lost.
Sunita, I'll marry you.
I will definitely marry you
Vijay!
Sunita!
What's the matter, Sunita?
You look very happy today!
Sister! God heard your prayers!
Vijay is ready to get married!
Really! - Yes!
And we are going to Khandala today.
Come in.
Who are you?
Ask my name later,..
..first ask me for
what I have come here.
Ok, you tell me for
what you have come here.
I have come here to
borrow something from you.
What do you want to borrow?
Your fiancé!
What nonsense is this!
I am in love with him.
Don't you dare touch him!
You are talking about touching!
I am in love with him!
And I achieve the thing I like.
But who the hell are you, bitch?
Looking at you,
it seems as if the mud of..
..the gutter has taken
the form of a woman!
I like your bad-words also.
The person you love,
I love him too.
Why don't we make a deal?
Let's cut him half.
You keep the nights,
and give me the days.
If you like that deal,
then shake hands.
Get out of here!
Get out, or I'll kill you!
Just get lost!
I'll kill you!
Today you cannot escape!
Hello. - Vijay,
Sunita has fainted!
What? Sunita has fainted! How?
A girl had come to meet Sunita..
..and they both started fighting.
And that girl changed
into a snake after sometime.
And Sunita is still unconscious.
Radha, I'm going out.
Take care of the child.
'A girl had come,..
'..and that girl changed into
a snake after sometime.'
Sunita, I was waiting for you.
Let's go.
Who is it?
Murgan!
Is sir in the house?
- No, he's not. Come in.
Come in.
What are you doing?
Are you married?
No, not yet.
Murgan, even I am not married!
What will you eat?
You got scared of such
a thin and weak girl!
Come, hug me!
Come! Come!
You sat on a hot plate!
You must have got heated up!
Let me see behind!
Listen!
He ran away! Murgan!
This was the first
boy in my life..
..and you snatched it from me.
Please send another
guy in my life!
I will offer a big
coconut in your temple!
Oh God!
She spilt all my milk!
Ghost!
Rascal!
I was just..
You look very happy!
It seems you have won the sky.
The sky is only 4 steps
away from the ground.
4! 1, 2, 3, 4!
Sunita, come closer to me, and..
..hug me and see what I am seeing.
I know you and your
intention very well.
That's why you won't be
able to achieve me so easily.
Only if somebody
will let you survive.
Hands of the lovers are very long,
aren't they?
Let's see how long your hands are.
Take your belonging, Baba.
Why? What about that snake?
I have finished off
that snake forever.
But.. But I'm sad that..
..I killed that serpent when
she had killed all my friends.
I am responsible
for their deaths, Baba!
I am responsible!
Why are you holding yourself
responsible for their deaths, dear?
This is the game of Almighty.
Wherever one has to die,
he will die over there.
Not even a single leaf
can shake without his wish.
SANSKRIT CHANTS
You! How did you come alive?
You were dead!
It's not so easy to kill me, Baba.
The fire of revenge that
a serpent has in her heart..
..it is more powerful than the
mantras in the talismans.
I've already killed five..
..now it is his turn.
No, I won't let you do that.
You can't do anything now.
Didn't I tell you?
I will win! This is my game!
So that he returns back
the talisman to you.
My way is clear now.
- He is not wearing protection..
..but I have the powers
to tie you.
You have played a lot with
the lives of human beings!
Now your game is over!
You can't escape from me now.
Goddess Snake,
my worship and the reputation..
..of my prayers is in your hands!
There is a battle
between good and bad.
That snake should not succeed in..
..the bad intentions of hers,
Goddess!
'Om Namah Shivaye'!
This is Vijay speaking.
I have finished off
the matter of that snake.
Really! But how did you do it?
I'll tell you when you come here.
I'm coming.
Vijay! Vijay!
What's the matter, Sunita?
You said that the snake is dead..
..but she is..
she is following me!
Where is the snake? - Over there.
Thank God you finished
off the snake forever, Vijay!
Yes Sunita!
Now no one can separate us.
Uncle!
What happened, dear?
Just now I had a very bad dream.
What did you see?
I saw that the snake has held you.
Dear, I have killed
that snake with my gun!
I shot her!
Go, go and drink your milk.
Radha, come here.
Give milk to the baby.
Anu's dream broke my dream.
My condition is become
like a visitor..
..who cannot find
an end to his destination.
Even my condition is the same,
darling..
..but everyone reaches
to the end one or the other day.
Those who don't have anyone;
they have God to help them.
Today your eyes are showing
the sparkle of love in them..
..and to bring them,
I need the support of a drink.
Today I'll fulfil all your wishes,
but very soon.
"Your love has affected
me in this way."
"Your love has affected
me in this way."
"I neither have any idea
about myself, nor about my heart."
"Your love has affected
me in this way."
"Your love has affected
me in this way."
"Wherever I see,
only you are visible to me."
"Your love has affected
me in this way."
"Your love has affected
me in this way."
"The way I have
got your love is.."
"..like the lanes
have got scenery."
"In the mirror I
have got a signal.."
"..like as if in a
storm I have got a shore."
"I am keeping a
watch on your eyes."
"Your love has affected
me in this way."
"Your love has affected
me in this way."
"My heart thinks this,
my beloved.."
"..instead of being
two souls we should unite."
"In your hands is death and life."
"Now the time has
come to make a decision."
"Now I cannot wait any longer!"
"Your love has affected
me in this way."
"Your love has affected
me in this way."
"I neither have any idea
about myself, nor about my heart."
You have lived enough!
One moment of my finger..
..can take away
your life from you.
The way you all took
away my life from me!
Hey snake, how can you kill me!
However hard the devil
tries what will happen?
Only that will happen
what God will want to happen.
Shoot me!
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!
Uncle, save me I will fall down!
Uncle, save me!
Uncle, save me I will fall down!
Uncle! Uncle!
Uncle! Uncle,
save me I will fall down!
Uncle, save me.
I will fall down! Uncle!
Fire brigade? Come to Cuff
Parade soon. 2 lives are in danger.
Hurry up. Please!
Uncle! Uncle,
save me I will fall down!
Uncle!
Uncle!
Uncle!
Hit! Hit!
To extinguish one
spark in your heart..
..you burned down so many houses.
If you will die like this then
this thing will remain incomplete.
People will say a snake
fell down from somewhere and died.
I want that you come
into your human form..
..and tell the people of this
world that what are you feeling?
Now I am feeling
that the worst fire..
..in this world
is the fire of revenge.
Whether it is in
a human or an animal.
The sweetest song
is the song of love.
Look over there,
my love is calling me!
Look over there.
My love is calling me.
My love is calling me!
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
"Even if I have to
leave this world for you."
"I will never break my
love relationship with you."
