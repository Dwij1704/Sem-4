Throw down and destroy all festive decorations,
let the people of Judah clothe themselves in mourning!
Minister of an angry God's wrath,
the King of Assyria has fallen on us now!
The horrible howlings of barbarian legions
have thundered in the Holy Temple of God!
Maidens, rend your white veils,
raise your arms in supplication;
the fervent prayer of innocent lips
is a pleasing perfume in the nostrils of the Lord!
Pray, maidens!






Through you may the fury
of the savage enemy legions be as naught!
Almighty God, Who fliest on the wings of the wind,
Who freest the lightning flash from the quivering cloud,
disperse, destroy the legions of Assyria,
let the daughter of David rejoice once more!
We have sinned! But in heaven may our prayers
obtain mercy and forgiveness for our frailty!
Oh, let not the wicked cry with blasphemous presumption:
"Does the God of Israel hide Himself for fear?"
Do not let Thy children fall prey
to a madman who scorns Thy everlasting might!
Do not permit the Assyrian foe to sit
among his false idols upon the throne of David!
Be of good cheer, my children!






Almighty God
in His might has vouchsafed a sign;
He has delivered a precious hostage
into my power:
the offspring of the enemy king
can bring us peace.
The sun of a more propitious day
has perhaps arisen for us!
Curb your fears!
Place your trust
in God's eternal help.
There upon the shores of Egypt
He procured Moses his life;
once He rendered invincible
the hundred men of Gideon?
Who, trusting in Him, has ever
perished in the hour of extremity?
The sun of a more propitious day...
has perhaps arisen for us!
What noise is that?
Furiously
the Assyrian king advances;
it seems he defies the whole world
in his haughty arrogance!
Let us die rather...
Heaven will perhaps
put an end to his wicked endeavours ?
the foe shall not rest upon the ruins of Zion.
I commit this first among Assyrian damsels
to your care!
Have mercy, o Lord!
As night before the shining sun,
as dust before the wind,
thou shalt vanish in the hour of trial,
of false god of Baal!
In Thy servants kindle a breath of fire
that shall deal death...
In Thy servants kindle the breath of fire
that shall deal death to the enemy.
In Thy servants kindle the breath of fire
that shall deal death to the enemy.
Fenena! Oh my beloved!
On the day of vengeance
who ever heard talk of love?
Unhappy girl! Oh, how much more
beautiful you appear to my eyes now than when,
as Ambassador to Babylon from Judah,
I came!
You took me out of prison at grave risk to yourself,
neither were you disturbed by the cruel
and envious vigilance of your sister,
who pursued me with
a raging passion!
Oh, why remind me! I am
a slave here now!
But I would unlock the way
to freedom for you!
Unhappy man! Now you are
betraying a sacred duty!
Come! You also broke it
for me!
Come!
My heart will open to you
the way through thousands.
- Soldiers, the Temple is taken!
Abigail!
Valiant soldier!
Do you know no other arms
save those of love?
In the heart of an Assyrian maid
such a flame seems wicked to me now!
What god will save you?
...Your tomb
will be your bridal couch...
The thunderbolt of my revenge
already hangs suspended over your heads!
I loved you!
I would have given
my kingdom and my heart for your heart!
This love is a raging fury,
it can give you life or death.
Oh, if you love me, I might
save your people yet!
Ah no! I will render you up my life,
but my heart I cannot give;
I am content with my fate,
but cannot, no, cannot fear for myself.
Ah! I call upon Thee now,
I recognize Thee now,
true God of Israel:
not for my sake in the hour of trial
be moved by my prayer?
? only protect my brother
and condemn me to weeping!
For them alone may my tears,
ah yes, my tears speak, speak for my people!
You saw him? Like thunder
he bursts into the thick of the fray!
Brandishing his bloody sword
he is heading this way!
In vain the soldiers offer their breasts
as shield to the Holy Temple!
Our prayers and our tears
are accursed in the sight of the Everlasting!
Happy the man who has not lived
to see this day!
Behold the King! Upon his steed,
he makes his way to the Temple,
like a whirlwind that brings everywhere
black ruin in its train.
What presumption! He does not
even dismount from his furious charger!
Calamity, alas! Who now will defend
the Temple of the Lord?
Long live Nebuchadnezzar!
Viva!
Who opened the way to the scoundrels?
False attire!
Pride will not help. The King comes this way.
What are you about?...
Tremble, madman!
This is the house of God!
What is that about God?
Before
you shall profane the Temple,
this dagger shall slay
your daughter!
I must dissemble, and my wrath
will burst forth all the stronger.
Let the madmen tremble at my anger.
Victims all they now shall fall!
Amid tears and groans wicked Zion
must welter in a sea of blood!
Father, have mercy!
I am near unto death for you here!
You can calm the vehemence of my anger,
Send us Thy aid, Almighty God!
New hope that shines before my eyes!
That girl who disputes my one and only love with me
will perhaps fall victim to revenge!
...Look down upon Thy children,
You can calm the vehemence of my anger,
new hope that shines before my eyes!
...who must now prepare themselves for cruel chains!
Amid tears and groans wicked Zion
must welter in a sea of blood!
Amid tears and groans wicked Zion
must welter in a sea of blood!
Down on your knees, defeated slaves!
I am the conqueror.
I challenged him in battle,
but did your God come?
He is afraid of me; who in the whole wide world,
you fools,
will be able to withstand me?
Wicked monster, see! The first victim
I slay will be this girl!
Do you thirst for blood? Let it
spill from your daughter's breast!
Stop!
Unhappy girl,
love will save you!
My fury, no longer constrained,
shall make horrible massacre of the conquered.
Plunder and burn the Temple;
mercy will be a crime!
Unhappy man, fond affection,
ah, has drawn a veil before his/my eyes!
Oh, the love that has set him/me so afire
will cover him/me with shame!
Mothers shall offer their breasts
in vain to shield their children!
Oh, fly from the accursed one
heaven and earth will cry.
Be rejected of men,
traitor to your brethren!
Your accursed name
shall be the shame of every age!
Oh, fly from the accursed one
heaven and earth will cry.
Sack and burn down the Temple!
Happy chance I found you, oh fatal document!
In his bosom the King tried to hide you, in order to prove
my shame!?
Abigail, issue of slaves!
Very well, let it be so! ?
Daughter of Nabucco
such as the Assyrians take me to be,
what am I here?
Worse than a slave!
The throne the King confides to the younger Fenena,
whilst he, among his soldiers, bends his mind
to exterminate Judaea!
Me he sends from the battlefield here
to observe the loves of others!
Oh, wretches all,
and even more deluded!
Little do you know
the heart of Abigail!
Upon everyone you will see
my fury fall!
Ah yes! Let Fenena fall...
my pretended father... the whole realm!
Upon me hurl thyself, oh fatal anger!
I, too, once opened
my heart to happiness!
Everything around me
I heard speak of holy love;
I wept at others' tears,
suffered at others' pain;
ah! to that lost enchantment
who will return me one day?
Who comes here?...
My eyes have witnessed
a terrible sight!
Oh! Of what do you speak?
Fenena is a wicked woman,
she is setting the Hebrews free!
Who now can check
this accursed rabble?
Power awaits you...
Come?
All is prepared.
We have already spread the rumour abroad
that the King has fallen in battle...
The people call for you as queen
to save the Assyrian land.
Only a step? fortune is yours.
Be stout of heart!
I am with you! Go!?
Oh, faithful subject, this woman
shall not yield to you in stalwart courage!
I now ascend the bloodstained seat
of the golden throne.
From that seat I shall be able
to take my revenge.
That the sceptre is mine by right
all peoples shall see! Ah!
Royal princesses will come hither
to beg favours of the humble slave.
And the vengeance of Baal
will thunder alongside yours!
Yes, alongside yours!
I now ascend the bloodstained seat
of the golden throne.
From that seat I shall be able
to take my revenge.
That the sceptre is mine by right
all peoples shall see!
Come, oh Levite!
Give me the Tables of the Law.
The Lord wishes me
to be agent of a new miracle.
He sends me as His servant
for the glory of Israel
to tear apart the darkness of an unbeliever.
On the lips of the prophets
Thou hast fulminated, o almighty God!
To Assyria in mighty accents
now speak Thou with my lips!
And with psalms sacred to Thee
every temple shall resound;
over the shattered idols
Thy law shall arise.
What can be wanted? Who can have summoned us
to this dubious place now so late at night?
The pontiff summons you...
Ismael!
Brethren!
- Oh, horror!
Away! Begone!
I implore your mercy!
Accursed of the Lord!
He who is accursed has no brethren...
no man on earth vouchsafes him a word!
Harsh lamentation everywhere arises,
the wind carries it to the impious wretch's ears!
On his brow, brilliant as the lightning flash,
shines God's fatal brand!
Poison is prepared for his lips in vain,
vainly the dagger would pierce his heart!
For love of the living God,
have done with your curses!
Fear is driving me mad!
Oh, death, for pity's sake!
Oh, brethren, forgive!
He saved a Hebrew maid!
Oh, what are you saying!
Raise psalms of thanksgiving
to God everlasting!...
It is true!
But what a tumult is mounting!
Oh heaven, what can it be?
Royal lady, fly! That cry of ill omen
..announces the death of my King!
- Oh, father!
Fly!
The people now call for Abigail,
and condemn these men here.
Why do I tarry longer?
I must not stay here!
To the midst of the impious rebels
I will hasten!
Stay! Oh, what a misfortune!
Glory be to Abigail!
Death to the Hebrews!
Now render up that crown!
I shall die first!
Take it from my head!
(The moment of direst wrath
is fast approaching;
upon their silent faces
terror already falls!
All about the thunderbolts
are poised ready to fall!
A day of mourning and vexation
is preparing;
The moment of direst wrath
is fast approaching
upon their silent faces
terror already falls!
All about the thunderbolts
are poised ready to fall!
A day of mourning and vexation
is preparing!)
The moment of direst wrath
is fast approaching...
Hear me now! Babylonians,
I throw your god to the ground!
He has rendered you traitors,
he wished to take you from my power.
Yours has fallen, oh foolish Hebrews,
fighting against me.
Hark to my words...
- There is only one god... your King!
- Heavens!
What have I heard!
Long live Nabucco!
Now bow down
your faces to the ground!
Worship me - me, God!
Madman! May your insane pride
be brought low ?
God will seize you by the hair of your head,
already he is robbing you of your throne!
Do you dare so much?
Oh, loyal followers, let this old man be conducted
to the foot of the idol.
He shall perish with his people!...
A Hebrew - I will die with them!
You lie! Oh, wretched girl, prostrate yourself
before my image!
I have embraced the Hebrew faith!
Down! Prostrate yourself!
I am king no more, I am God!
See how avenging heaven
has struck the presumptuous man!
Who is it that takes my royal sceptre from me?
What horrid spectre is pursuing me?
Who seizes me, alack, by the hair?
Who is crushing me?... Who lays me low?
Oh my daughter! Do you even
not help to support me in my weakness?
Alas, I am surrounded by phantoms?
they having flaming swords of fire!
And the blood red sky has fallen
upon my head! Ah, upon my head!
Why, oh why did a tear
start from my eye?
Who will support me?... I am fainting...
Heaven has
punished the boaster!
But the greatness of the people
of Baal shall not be eclipsed!
Assyria is a queen
as powerful as Baal upon earth;
she deals destruction everywhere,
if the stranger challenge her to war.
Now among the joys of peace,
worthy reward of valour,
she wilt pass her smiling days
in happiness and love.
Now among the joys of peace,
just reward of valour,
she will pass her smiling
days in happiness and love,
Peerless lady, ruler of
Assyria's fate,
hear the prayers of your faithful subjects.
The wicked children of Judah must all be destroyed,
and, first and foremost, that woman,
whom I dare not call your sister.
She has betrayed Baal.
What are you asking of me!...
But who comes here?
What presumptuous fellow is it
that breaks my royal interdiction?
Conduct the old man
back to his apartments!
Who dares raise his voice
in the presence of Nabucco?
Deign to follow me, my lord!
Whither would you lead me? Let me be!
This is the council chamber...
Stay! Do you not see?
They are awaiting me.
Why do you support me?
I am weak, it is true,
but woe if anyone should know it!
I wish everyone to think me still strong.
Let go of me... I will find my seat myself...
Who is this woman?
Oh, what effrontery!
Withdraw, loyal subjects!
Woman, who are you?
Custodian
of your throne I came hither!
You? Of my throne? Ch, imposture!
Were you commanded to do so by me?
Oh, imposture!
You lay sick ?The people
cried out against the rebellious Hebrew;
you must set your royal seal
to their decree!
Death is writ here for the wicked rebels.
- What are you saying?
Sign.
(A thought troubles me!)
You refuse?
Arise then, happy Hebrews!
Lift up hymns of glory to your God!
What is that I hear!
Seized with cowardly dismay,
Nabucco is no longer himself!
You lie! Let death, death
be dealt to the whole of Israel!
Give me the parchment!
Oh, what good fortune is mine!
The last obstacle is surmounted!
Oh!... But what of Fenena?
Traitress!
She has given herself to the false God!
Oh, she shall die!
She is my flesh and blood!
No one can save her!
Oh, horror!
Another daughter...
Bow low,
slave, before your lord!
Quickly!...
Fool! Here I wished to await you!
Me, a slave?
Learn the truth!
Thus do I return, miserable creature,
the lying document to you!
(Oh, what deep shame afflicts my grey hairs!
In vain my failing hand
flies to my once feared sword!
Oh, wretched old man!
You are but the shadow of the King!)
(Oh, day of long coveted glory,
thou art come!)
(Woe is me!)
(The throne is worth far more
than a lost father!)
(At last the people will fall
at the base slave's feet.)
What sound is that?
It is the death knell of the
Hebrews you have condemned!
Ho there, guards! I am betrayed!
Guards, I say!
Oh fool! Do you still oppose me?
These guards I have kept in
reserve solely for you, prisoner!
Prisoner?
Yes, of a slave
who scorns your might!
Prisoner?
Yes!
Oh, pardon, oh, forgive
a father who is mad!
Oh, give me back my daughter;
do not bereave a father!
Then let the people of Assyria
call you lady and queen!
This old man asks nothing of you
but the life of his heart's delight!
Be off! You beg grace of me in vain,
I am unmoved by your belated tears.
Such you were not, presumptuous old man,
when you reserved dishonour for me.
Oh, pardon, oh, forgive
a father who is mad!
Oh, give me back my daughter;
do not bereave a father!
I am unmoved by your belated tears.
Begone!
It will be seen now, if the royal mantle
ill becomes this slave!
It will be seen now,
if I besmirch the grandeur of Assyria!
You beg grace of me in vain.
Ah, no.
Oh, pardon!
Begone!
Fly, thought, on wings of gold;
go settle upon the slopes and the hills,
where, soft and mild, the sweet airs
of our native land smell fragrant!
Greet the banks of the Jordan
and Zion's toppled towers.
Oh, my country so lovely and lost!
Oh, remembrance so dear and so fraught with despair!
Golden harp of the prophetic seers,
why dost thou hang mute upon the willow?
Rekindle our bosom's memories,
and speak of times gone by!
Mindful of the fate of Jerusalem,
either give forth an air of sad lamentation,
or else let the Lord imbue us
with fortitude to bear our sufferings!
Oh, who is it that weeps?
Who is it raises lamentations,
as of timorous women, to the Everlasting?
Oh, rise up,
brothers in anguish,
the Lord speaks from my lips.
In the obscurity of the future I see?
Behold, the shameful chains are broken!
The wrath of the Lion of Judah
already falls upon the treacherous sand!
Oh, happy future!
To settle upon the skulls, upon the bones,
hither come the hyenas and the snakes;
midst the dust raised by the wind
a doomed silence shall reign!
The owl alone will spread abroad
its sad lament when evening falls...
Not a stone will be left to tell the stranger
where once proud Babylon stood!
Oh, what a fire burns in the old man!
The Lord speaks through his lips!
Yes, the shameful fetters shall be broken,
the courage of Judah is rousing already!
These are my limbs!
Through the woods
was I not fleeing,
painting
like a hunted beast?
Oh, it was a dream... a terrible dream!
Now, behold the cry of war! My sword, ho!
My charger, that thirsts for battle
as a young girl longs for dancing!
Oh, my valiant troops, Zion, that proud city, see,
towering here... She must be ours, let her fall in ashes!
that proud city, see, towering here...
She must be ours, let her fall in ashes!
Fenena!
From the lips of my faithful subjects
my daughter's name falls!
See, she comes running
between ranks of soldiers!
Alas! Am I dreaming?
Why are her hands bound in chains?...
She is weeping!
To death with Fenena!
Oh! I am a prisoner!
God of the Hebrews, forgive me!
Judah's God the altar, the Temple
sacred to Thee shall rise again.
Oh, rescue me from this terrible anguish
and I will destroy my rites.
Thou hearest me!...
The wicked wretch's sick
and sinful mind is clearing already!
True and omnipotent God,
I will worship Thee from henceforth always.
Open now, fatal door!
My lord, where are you hastening?
Let me be!
You wish to go forth,
so that your sick mind may be affronted?
We have come here to defend you!
What are you saying? My mind
is no longer deranged!
Abdallo, my sword, my sword...
To regain the throne
here it is, oh King!
I would save Fenena!
The traitors shall fall, fall
like locusts to the ground!
Through you we shall see the sun
shine upon Assyria once again!
Follow me, my valiant men!
Day opens to my mind,
I burn with unaccustomed ardour,
I am King of Assyria once more!
At the flashing of this blade
the wicked shall fall, fall to the ground!
We shall see everything shine bright
in the gleaming sun of my crown.
Come on, let's go.
Through you we shall see it shine bright,
come,
we shall see it shine bright,
the sun above Assyria.
Come on, let's go.
Go, win the palm of martyrdom,
go and win it, oh pure young maid!
You have been too long in exile.
Your country is in heaven!
...Hasten!
Oh, the firmament is opened up!
My soul longs for the Lord...
He smiles upon me and reveals to me
hundred upon hundred of joys everlasting!
Oh, splenclour of the stars, farewell!
God floods me with His holy light!
From this mortal body that, heavy as lead, detains us here,
my soul escapes already and wings its way to heaven!
Long live Nabucco!
What cry is that?
Long live Nabucco!
Let the rite be consummated!
Stop, wicked wretches!
Soldiers, shatter
the baneful idol, like dust to the ground!
Divine miracle!
Oh, return once more, Israel,
return to the delights of thy native land!
Let a new Temple be raised to thy God?
He alone is great, mighty is He alone!
The wicked tyrant was a dement king,
now God gave peace to the repentent king..
Only He is imense..
Daughter, let's adore Him
Great Jehovah
... who has not felt Thy might?
Who is not as dust...
...in Thy sight?
Almighty Jehovah,
- who has not felt Thy might?
- Jehovah!
- Who is not as dust in Thy sight?
- Jehovah!
Doest Thy rainbow span the firmament?
All things are radiant.
Dost Thou unleash the thunderbolt?
Man is as naught.
Oh, whom do I see?
Why does the wretched girl
now drag herself hither?
To me... faint... dying...
let your pardon be vouchsafed!
Fenena, I was to blame...
I am punished for it now!
Come! These two loved one another...
May they place their hopes in you!
Who will now relieve me of the iron
burden of my crime?
Ah! You have said, oh people:
"God lifts up the afflicted."
I implore Thee, oh God, Thee I do revere?
Let me not be damned!
Let me not be damned!
She is dead!
Servant of Jehovah,
you shall be king of kings.
