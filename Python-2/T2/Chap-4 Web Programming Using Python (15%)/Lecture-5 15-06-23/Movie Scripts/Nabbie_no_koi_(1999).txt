Kenji!
Listen!
Nanako?
You came back from Tokyo,
looking like a Japanese girl
Every one's getting sick of your
rough driving
I can't drive like a woman.
They are all used to it anyway
Sit down here, Nanako
It's dangerous.
I could get pregnant
Then we'll get married
Sit down!
You should listen to your fianc?
I'm not your fianc?e






Don't get cross.
Time of the month?
Shut up! You idiot!
Oi! Watch it. Back to your seat
Is he from the island?
Don't know
That old chap looks real cool
NABBIE'S LOVE
That's Nanako's boat arriving
Hurry up!
That man must be from the island.
Don't you think?
If he was, I'd recognise him
Can we shag, if I check it?
Shut up!
Grandma, how are you?






I'm very well
You look beautiful, Nanako
No doubt!
Get on
Come see me, Nanako
Nanako, come have some
They are really blooming
She has started talking to them,
as if they were her babies
That's why they blossom so well
How long are you staying?
Don't know
This is your home.
Stay as long as you want
Has Dad said anything?
No
I've quit my job
How come?
Well...
- You're pregnant?
- What?
- Japanese baby?
- No way!
Then, Kenji's baby?
Grandpa, I'm not pregnant
They are beautiful
Yes, they are. I told them
you were coming home
Ouch!
You OK?
Bougainvillea has thorns
I'm OK
Grandma, can I keep one pot?
No. You'll spoil it
I won't. I'll take care of it
You won't be able to
Let's go see the patriarch.
Come on. Hurry up
Our respectable ancestors...
Nanako, the granddaughter of our
south branch, Nabbie's family,
...has just come back from Japan
May she stay well, while she is here
Don't drink too much
Today is the thirteenth day
with the beautiful moon
Everything is in love,
trees, flowers, fish and frogs
Why not us?
- Don't you agree, Misa?
- Yes, I do
I fell in love with you...
that spring when I was nineteen
If you are going to leave me now...
make me feel nineteen again
Even a post card...
can reach miles away
We live on the same island...
but can't reach each other
No matter how much I think
about you...
You already have somebody
I am not an innocent girl anymore...
I am still stuck with the memories
of my first love
Nabbie, I'm going to feed the cows
Bring me lunch at twelve thirty,
will you?
OK See you later
Good morning, Grandma
You OK? Got a hangover?
That was nothing
Are you not going with Grandpa
to take care of the cows anymore?
It's become hard, since my back
started aching
Grandpa says I can do it
only when I feel well
He's still in love with you,
isn't he?
You shouldn't make fun
of an old woman
Wow, he's still around?
Yes. Lately he's often invited
to perform for celebrations
Long time no see, aunt Reiko
Hi, tomboy Nanako!
Wow, you are pregnant?
Yes. It's a baby. I'm not chubby
Congratulations!
Thank you. I'm O'Connor
Ouch! Too tight
Congratulations. Sorry
He's strong, isn't he?
Gentle heart and strong body
Right, darling?
I love you, Reiko
I love you too
Reiko, will you sing
my favourite song?
I thought I could stay...
with you for ever
I will never forget our farewell
until my life ends
What's the matter, Grandma?
Where is he from?
Mr. O'Connor?
He's from I... I..."I-love-land"
No, actually, it's "I-love-you-land"
or something like that
"I-love-you-land"?
- Ir... Ir... Oh! Ireland?
- That's it!
He came from the far away I-love-
you-land across the ocean after Reiko
Wow, he's passionate
I'd like to go to
I-love-you-land as well
Me too
But I get seasickness and
can't go so far
Look, Nanako,
I have something to do
I'll see you later at home
I'll come with you
Never mind. I won't be long
You are getting married to Kenji,
aren't you?
What?
Blood type A and O get along well
Does big Kenji love big Nanako?
Sure he does
And you, big Nanako?
None of your business
You love him! You are blushing!
Shut up! You stupid brats!
Holy shit!
Hey man,
do you have a cigarette?
Sorry?
The thing you smoke
Oh, here you are
That's an expensive brand
What?
Are you sightseeing?
Not really
There's nothing on this island.
Only cows
You get chicks with big tits
on the next island
I didn't come for that
Then you are weird
You should be quick with women
What?
Women never for get the first man
You think so?
Sure. Got a light?
Oh, sorry
My wife can be a nag.
I can't smoke at home
Sorry about that
She's the best "churakagi"
on the island, though
I mean the most beautiful woman
She used to have big tits too
But small tits can be
very nice as well
Can they?
Who's there?
Is it you, Nabbie?
Is it you, Sun Ra?
You've been looking after
my family tomb?
Respectable ancestors,
...I left the island for a far away
country called Brazil
I couldn't come back for a long time
I have no family here any longer
Forgive me for letting our
family die out
Nabbie, we have a guest
Nanako, where is she?
I thought she was with you
Well? I've seen you
- He's from Japan, called Fukutaro...
- No. I'm Fukunosuke
Sorry. I've brought him
because he likes you
I've never said that
Don't be shy
He likes small tits
Please...
Anyway, come in
I swear I've never said that
Nice arse, isn't it?
Stop it!
She's blushing
You see, she likes you
There is Nanako doing the washing
She has a cute round bottom
"I have cute round tits too"
"Please feel them. I can't wait"
For what?
"Please feel them. I can't wait"
Nabbie! Where have you been?
Well... let me do it, Nanako
Nabbie, you know what time it is?
Where have you been?
Thanks, Fukunosuke.
He's always like this
Not at all. Thank you for dinner
Nanako, wake up
Show him the way
I hope you can put up with
this dirty hut
Nanako, is that edible?
That Guava? Yes
Then let's eat
- Would you open your legs?
- What?
A little higher
OK I got it
It's delicious!
It's always been wonderful
Absolutely
Thank you for everything
Good night
- Nabbie, I'm going to feed the cows
- I'm going with him
Bring me lunch at twelve forty
Good morning
Where's Grandpa?
He's gone to the farm
with Fukunosuke
Has he?
Will you deliver lunch to the farm
at twelve forty?
Grandma, where are you going?
I'll be back soon
I know you are there. Come out
Listen, you are detectives, right?
Follow Grandma, and let me know
where she's going
What for?
- No questions. Just do it!
- What's the reward?
All right. I'll buy you ice cream
Shhhh... Detectives work discreetly
I'll be at the beach
I know that you always
take your nap here
What can I do for you?
Something is strange about Grandma
You know anything?
Don't know
Oh, I got some information
about that cool old chap
He used to live on this island
before the war
How did you find out?
Everybody's talking
Kenji...
You don't have to say "I love you".
I know it
You fool!
- Are you angry now?
- No, I'm not
- Let's get married, then
- Why should I?
- You got somebody in Japan?
- None of your business!
Then, marry me
I don't want to marry yet
I'll make you happy with my dick.
Look at this
You idiot!
Big Nanako, please come!
It's an emergency
What is it?
Nanako, wait!
- Tell me, what is it?
- Just come see
Aaaaah!
Shit!
You fool, why are you
walking here?
What's the matter, Nanako?
Shut up and move your arse!
OK
Sun Ra, I would be happy...
if you could have this flower pot
close to you from now on
This flower must be the one I...
I didn't come back to this island
only to look after my family tomb
I came back to keep the promise
we made sixty years ago
Sun Ra...
Your scent...
brings back old memories
I've tried to forget you
so desperately,
...but I just couldn't
Don't tell anybody
what you've just seen
It's going to rain. Let's get back
You say you want to be
nineteen again
Look at the dead tree
in the garden
If the tree could have
flowers again...
Grilled fish could swim again
Even if you are leaving me...
I won't be sentimental about you
When you are still young...
don't regret and just look forward
to tomorrow's flowers
What's your guess?
Is big Nanako going to choose big
Kenji or that Japanese, Fukunosuke?
- Whoever does it first
- Does what?
They must've done it already
Fukunosuke has an advantage,
cos he's at Nanako's. Kenji's behind
Tell me, what do they do?
Nanako, what are you doing here?
You should be at home
Daddy, what are you doing here?
Nabbie and you are giving me
a headache
Keiichi, why didn't you tell me
that Sun Ra's back?
Sorry, but I didn't have a clue
Shit!
You knew it all along, Nanako
Don't know
You fools should realise.
It's a big crisis in our family
Our shaman, Tsuru, has arrived!
Gods of the heaven,
Gods of the island,
...and our ancestors
I understand it very well
We shall follow your words
Gods of the heaven,
Gods of the island,
...and our ancestors are all
strongly against...
Sun Ra staying on this island
That's it!
Let's kick him off the island
Please wait
I beg you don't
It's not your place to decide,
Nabbie
What would you say, Keitatsu?
What? Are you kidding with me?
Sun Ra's come back to the island to
pay his respects to his family tomb
I swear I'll never see him again
So please let him stay
All right
He may stay
But remember,
he's an evil force on the island
Nobody should see him
Even if you see him,
don't look into his eyes
Is that clear?
Nabbie,
if you run away with Sun Ra,
...your family will die out at once
I know you have a backache
That's your ancestors' fury
You forget him,
and you'll be better soon
Thank you very much
You are Nanako, aren't you?
Remember you have been destined
to marry Kenji...
and your family will flourish
But be careful, you have Nabbie's
blood running inside you
You could also ruin your family
That damn hanky-panky shaman!
I hate it here
Damn! I've missed it
Let me do it
Wow, you are good
I didn't know the moon
could be so bright
This is so great.
Oh, I love this island
Should be grilled a little more
No way! I haven't had a bite yet
The moon is beautiful on
the thirteenth night
A girl is beautiful at seventeen
Ho-i-cho-ga
Seiko, you are so lovely
It hurts
Don't work too hard.
You'll hurt your back again
Are you really selling her?
I can get a good deal now
But you loved her too
Yes, I do. But we need money
Seiko, so long
I'm afraid she'll get sick
on the boat
Nabbie, you'll hurt your back again.
Go home and rest
Don't do anything. Just have a rest
- How was Nabbie?
- She's asleep at home
Good
- Can I have one?
- Sure
You smoke? You are a girl
Girls smoke these days
Don't you mind if your wife is
a sleepyhead, drinker, and smoker?
Not at all
- No problem? OK?
- OK
You are lucky, Nanako
Start working on making a baby
with Fukutaro
I'm Fukunosuke
Tell me, Grandpa...
about Grandma and Sun Ra
I knew it from the beginning...
Nabbie had somebody
before she married me
And that was Sun Ra
"NABBIE'S NINETEENTH SPRING -
An Okinawan Sad Love Story"
Before 1940, before the war...
we were kids and used to peek
at their rendezvous
There was this atmosphere
unknown to us...
that made us excited
Shortly afterwards,
Nabbie became pregnant,
... but her family didn't approve
of their relationship
Also the shaman forbade
their marriage
And they were separated
Our ancestors are furious about them
Nabbie's family will die out,
if she stays with him
Sun Ra should be exiled
from the island
Can you untie the rope?
No. We'll be punished
Go get the pot over there
If you release me,
I'll give you something
But we'll be in trouble
OK I'll do it
Keitatsu, you'll be punished!
Will you marry me, when I grow up?
I will. If you let me go now
Sun Ra! Please take me with you
I promise to come back for you
Don't make me wait too long
I thought I could stay
with you for ever
I will never forget our farewell
Nabbie couldn't
get off the island
She also lost her baby
Some years later I became her
husband and joined her family
I was very happy
It's been sixty years since then...
long, long ago
Come here
Let me show you something
You just sit down here
How is it? It's good, isn't it?
I sold Seiko and bought this
massage chair
You... thank you very much
Look, you can choose the best
position with this
It's good, isn't it
I appreciate you've been working
very hard with me for a long time
I have to prepare dinner
Never mind. Nanako will do it
You just stay here and rest
Please don't do anything today
Just relax and rest
You are so kind.
I feel much better now
Where are you going, Grandma?
To the loo
Don't follow me around
like a small kid
I want to pee too
Grandma,
can't you forget Sun Ra?
Grandma?
No, I can't
How about Grandpa?
Grandma?
I like him very much
Then what are you going to do?
I can't forget Sun Ra,
...but I've lived with Grandpa
for fifty years...
and I am going to live
with him for ever
Promise?
Promise
Please don't just disappear
I won't. Don't be silly
We are Pinocchio from Osaka.
We are Pinocchio from Osaka.
What an end-of-the-worldish
place it is here!
- It's a wonderful place
- Yes. I love this island
You, liar!
I have much to say about
Aguni Island
- AGUNI ISLAND!!!
- You are just saying it out loud
This is a traditional song of
the island, the Munjuru song
Cool, Fukunosuke!
You look gorgeous!
Kenji, kick him!
Tackle him
People are delighted with us
back in Osaka, but not here
No, not really
Now here comes the idol
of this island
Nanako. Please
Good night
Dear Sun Ra,
We once promised to
live and die together,
...but we were forced to separate
by our families,
... like one tree being torn apart
For these long sixty years...
I have struggled to forget you,
... but I just couldn't
I thought I could never see you again
in this world,
...but your warm heart kept
our promise to become one again
Your heart has brought back
old memories....
and my heart is stirred
When the northerly wind ceases and
brings calmness to the sea,
...I am going to the West Beach
Please take me away with you
to wherever it might be
When the wind ceases to blow
... I will be there waiting for you
It's a beautiful day today
The northerly wind has
cleared the sky
Yes, it has
The sea will be calm as well today
Nabbie, ask Nanako to bring me
lunch today
Are you sure?
Nanako, bring me lunch today,
will you?
All right
Nabbie, don't overwork.
Take care of yourself
Thank you, and you too
All right, I'm off
Tell Nanako to bring me
lunch at twelve
Hello, Keitatsu
Mr. Sun Ra, it's been sixty years
You like fish, don't you?
Have you been on the sea
this morning?
I hadn't been out to sea
for a long time
Nobody can beat you
when it comes to fishing
Keitatsu, I'm leaving the island
Are you? I wish you all the best
So long
Our great Sun Ra...
the world flourishes as you go
You are the hope of women
We ask you to take care of them
Nanako, too much water can
spoil the flowers
Really?
Keep that pot, Nanako
Sure? Thank you.
I'll take care of it
It's time to go to the farm
Take care of Grandpa
Is it that good?
I tell you, it's addictive
Good. See you later
- Put that one over there
- This one's not ready yet
Turn it over
Where did you get the fish?
I caught them from the sky
What?
Your lunch looks gorgeous today.
Can I try some?
No way! Nanako's made yours
But yours looks nicer
Stop it! This is mine
I know I'm not
as good as Grandma
How was Nabbie?
She gave me a pot
of Bougainvillea
Did she?
Anything wrong?
Nothing
What is it?
No problem
Tell me, what is it?
It's about that Bougainvillea...
What about it?
He got exiled from the island
and went to Brazil
- Who did?
- Sun Ra
And?
After 1945, after the war...
an airmail arrived for Nabbie
just once...
without the sender's name
I tried to see through it
against the sunlight
It seemed there was a
kind of twig inside
It was since then that Nabbie
started keeping Bougainvillea
I'm off!
Have some fish
Grandma?
Where are you?
Grandma!
- Have you seen Grandma?
- She's gone to the sea
Let me borrow your bike
Grandma!
Where are you going?
Please don't go!
Come back!
Grandma...
Kenji, get your boat, please!
- What is it?
- I'll tell you later. Please hurry!
- I haven't even put petrol in yet
- I don't care. Please!
Grandma...
Grandma!
Please don't go, Grandma!
Thank you for everything, Nanako
I'm going to I-love-you-land
with Sun Ra
We've run out of petrol!
You can't, Grandma!
You'll get sick on the boat
Not with my I-love-you-lander
How about Grandpa?
He's still young. Take care of him
You promised not to
disappear like this
I've always loved Sun Ra
I'll be happy with him
Grandma!
Grandma, take care of yourself
I wish you well
Grandma!
Are you leaving the island too?
Going back to Tokyo?
Don't know
Nanako, please don't go
I don't know
We'll be happy together too
I dooooon't know!
Marry me, Nanako
I can't
I like you, but it's not love
It's OK I love you.
Let's get married
Kenji, but I don't love you
You know your family will die out
Nanako! I won't give up.
I will love you for ever
She's gone
- What did you say?
- Nothing. Let's take a rest
Sure
There's a breeze in the air
Change of the season
The wind's blowing in circles
and getting stronger
Let's finish our work quickly
You're learning, Fukunosuke
Trust me!
- How much?
- This much
Nanako?
What's happened, Nanako?
Don't worry, Nanako
Big Nanako
I fell in love with you...
that spring when I was nineteen
If you are going to leave me now...
make me feel nineteen again
Even a postcard...
can reach miles away
We live on the same island...
but can't reach each other
Even if you are leaving me...
I won't be sentimental about you
When you are still young...
don't regret and just look forward
to tomorrow's flowers
Grandpa,
I've decided to stay here
With Fukunosuke?
That's great, Fukunosuke
You'll be a great husband
of the island. Wonderful!
Nanako! Sing!
No matter how much I love you...
Fukunosuke!
You are so aloof
I'm not the same person as I was...
you are the one
who is responsible
Fukunosuke! Do something!
You say I'm responsible, Nanako...
I'm just a poor in-law
I'm coming to see you tonight...
please wait for me in bed
Grandpa! Please sing!
Keitatsu, go ahead!
There is a bird in the mountain,
...taking a nap on a plum twig,
...dreaming of flowers falling,
...and warbling feebly
Please, everyone
My granddaughter, Nanako, and
Fukunosuke from Japan
...are going to marry and
stay on the island
Please wish them
a happy marriage
...and celebrate together
How shall we describe
this delightful day?
The dew has helped the
flowers blossom
Let's dance together, you, me
and everyone
Let's have fun today
Think about tomorrow
when it comes
Until the dawn comes
with the sunrise
Let's dance together all night
You, me and everyone...
