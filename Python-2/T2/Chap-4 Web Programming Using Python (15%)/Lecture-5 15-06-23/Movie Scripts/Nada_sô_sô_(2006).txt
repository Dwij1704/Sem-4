Excuse me.
Good morning!
Morning.
Ah! It's seriously hot in here!
Good morning.
Tsumabuki Satoshi
Morning.
Good morning.
Morning!
Good morning.
Nagasawa Masami






Hey, Youta.
Yo!
Get out of the way!
Hello.
Hey! Hello.
Please sign this.
Okay, okay. It sure is hot!
Hey, you've grown up!
He's going to be a first grader next year.
Tsukamoto Takashi
Asou Kumiko
Morning!
Hi, hello.
Hello.
Koizumi Kyouko






Hi, auntie, has your back healed?
I'm fine. You take care of your health too.
Okay, thanks.
Director: Doi Nobuhiro
Hello.
Thanks for you hard work, Youta.
Ah, you too.
Bye, auntie.
Ah! Auntie, you are always so beautiful.
If you always think so, don't just say it today.
Right, you got me.
Oh, You-chan you are finished for today?
("-chan," suffix for close friends.)
Yes.
("-chan," suffix for close friends.)
What's going on, You-chan?
Why are you worried about your looks?
You know...
I know! He must be going out on
a date with that beautiful girlfriend of his.
On a date?!
No, no! My little sister.
My little sister is leaving the Island.
She was accepted in a high school here.
You had a younger sister?
Yes, it's Naha North High School.
What!?
She's really smart, just like me!
What are you talking about?
Who got the worst grade in high school?
It was definitely you!
Only because you quit school!
Was it?
Hey, what's your sister like?
Is she cute?
- Not really.
Is she cute?
What's her name?
Wait, turn this around.
Whoa! Be careful!
Tell me!
You think I'll hit on her?
How can I do something like that to
my best friend's little sister?
I'm telling you, she's just a country girl.
A brat raised in the Island.
She has no sex appeal, just like a boy!
She was always number one in
the Island's Sumo contest.
Sumo contest?
Right. An unbelievably stubborn girl.
Oh! I have to get back to the construction site.
I'm coming back later.
Don't forget to introduce her to me!
No way! I'll never introduce her to you.
You have to!
No way!
Come on! Pull yourself together!
Wait...
You have to be good to her.
Starting today,
she will be your sister.
Mommy...
Got married.
Was she okay?
Just a tiny cut right here.
She's fine.
Are you Youta?
I hope you can get along with Kaoru.
Kaoru-chan, it's Niinii.
Niinii - A very childish way
of saying "Big brother" in Okinawa Dialect.
Okay, thanks for waiting. Tacos and Taco-rice.
Taco-rice: An Okinawan specialty food.
Tacos stuffings on top of rice, with spicy salsa.
Wait, Niinii!
I'm over here.
Niinii!
Kaoru, this way.
Hey, uncle, I'm going to get my sister now.
Uncle - Especially in the countryside, an old
person who is a friend, even if not related.
Daddy went somewhere.
Youta...
If mommy is gone...
The two of you go to grandma's place on the Island.
And...
Promise me...
That no matter what, you will protect Kaoru.
Because she's all alone.
so you have to protect her.
"Linking Fingers" is an agreement of a promise mostly
to kids and sometimes playfully between friends.
Youta.
Don't cry.
When your tears are about to flow...
Niinii!
Niinii!
Nada .
[Tears .
Nada Sou .
[Tears Flowing .
Nada Sou Sou.
[Tears Flowing Endlessly].
That was refreshing.
I'm gonna take a drink!
Did you pick these curtains for me?
Huh? Why do you ask?
How should I put this? A bit too cute...
Or a bit too childish...
You have a bad taste in these things!
It's great! What's wrong with them?
Kaoru.
Kaoru!
Huh?
Don't walk around wearing clothes like that.
Why?
You are a girl!
Anyway, just come help me.
Ahhh!
What?
I didn't think Niinii turned into
such an annoying old man!
"Old man"? I'm still only 21!
So? Everyone's an old man after 20.
AhhEhh?!
What?!
What's this?! It's mad delicious!
Duh! Why do you think I have chef license for?
(Cooks must pass an exam to
become a chef of a restaurant in each prefecture.)
Niinii, is it true you want to open a restaurant in the future?
become a chef of a restaurant in each prefecture.)
Yeah.
I thought you were just joking.
When I say I'm going to do something, I do it.
My plans are slowly progressing.
Really...
Kaoru!
Watch your manners.
Whoa!
Good.
Hey! What are you doing?
I'm sleeping here tonight.
What? No!
You can use that room over there.
Come on! It's been so long since we met.
Are you scared?
What?
The sound of rain.
No.
You are scared!
No!
There are many things I want to talk to you.
Just for tonight.
Brings back memories.
Grandma missed you.
You don't come back and visit us in the Island.
I was busy with things here.
You dropped out of high school without telling us too.
Kaoru.
What?
You were accepted in a good high school,
so study hard.
Okay.
You are the only one from the Island
who made it, as far as I know.
Okay.
Hey, did you know?
Our neighbor Mii-chan finally got married!
No way!
It's true! He's 4 years younger than her!
Then, uncle Yasu made a girlfriend!
You serious?!
Kaoru?
Kaoru?
Kaoru?
Youta, what's wrong?
What is it?
I can't find Kaoru!
Kaoru!
Kaoru!
Kaoru!
Kaoru!
Kaoru!
Kaoru?
Kaoru!
Niinii!
Kaoru!
Niinii!
I wanted to go home, I wanted to go to Kino Bay,
then I got lost!
Niinii, Niinii!
Niinii!
Kino Bay is on the other side of this sea.
We rode a ferry to get here, remember?
Isn't mommy in Kino Bay?
Mommy died already.
What happens to dead people?
Well...
I don't know.
Kaoru.
Hmm?
When your tears are about to flow...
This is what you do.
Then your tears will stop flowing.
Mommy taught me that.
Ahh!
There are so many people in the city!
There must be as many people as
our Island just in this block!
Isn't that right? Niinii!
Right.
This is the first time we go out for
a drive together, right?
Yes.
What's wrong, Niinii?
Are you not feeling well?
No.
Then what?
Huh? Just...
Just what?
Huh?
Just want to introduce you to someone.
Who?
Who is it, Niinii?
She's the person who gave you
that curtain for present.
Kei-chan.
Hello.
You know! That's how it is.
What! Come on, Niinii!
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Hello, I'm his younger sister, Kaoru.
Nice to meet you, I'm Inamine Keiko.
I'm Kaoru, Arakaki Kaoru.
Really?! She's in Medical
Department of Ryukyu University?
Yeah. Right? Kei-chan.
Wow!
You can ask her anything you
don't know in your homework!
Why are you showing off?
I would be glad to help you.
Yes, thank you very much.
But Niinii,
how did you find such a beautiful
and smart girlfriend?
Of course through my ability!
My charm as a man!
What happened? Where did he hit on you?
Hey! Listen to my story!
What happened?!
Do you mind if I tell her?
I don't really mind.
I was drinking with my friend, and got drunk.
When I almost got hit on by some bunch of guys,
your brother saved me.
You were drunk?
I was a bit too excited when I found out
I was accepted to the university.
That's when 'this guy' gave me a long lecture
while he was working at the bar.
What did he say?
He told me "Girls have to protect themselves."
Reeaally...
He acts like he's so great.
That's right! He acted like he's so great.
Right? "Niinii".
Wait a minute there! You are older than me!
Ah! You just mentioned the topic that bothers me most.
Unbelievable! That's the mistake you always make!
Wait! You are lecturing me?
I'm sorry my brother is like that.
Hey! Listen to what I say!
Ah! Come on, Niinii!
She sure is an energetic girl.
She's just immature.
There are no amusement parks on the Island,
so she's just excited.
I don't think that's all there is to it.
Huh?
She's happy she got to live with her big brother at last.
Besides...
I'm sure she's not as immature as you think she is.
But...
From now, I won't be able to sleep in your room.
His underwear?
Right, right. It has a ridiculously weird pattern on it.
It's one of those ones old people wear!
Right, right!
I knew it! You have seen it!
Youta's underwear.
I'm gonna slap you!
What are you guys talking about?
We were just saying how you are so admirable,
saving money to open a restaurant one day.
Right? Midori.
That's right.
Like how you always take our leftovers
to save on your food expenses,
and how you accept everything from aunties
in the marketplace, from bean sprouts to underwear!
Just kidding! We were not talking about that.
Right?
Nope.
Or like, how you took our truck for free,
or how you remodeled your room from a garage,
and renting it for 30 bucks a month.
We weren't talking about that at all.
And that bed in his room was the one he stole from
the doctor's office at night when it was about to get torn down.
What?! Really?
Kei-chan!
You two sure are siblings!
Your faces look exactly the same when you laugh!
You two really have the same face when you laugh!
No! Really? How embarassing!
Hey! What's that supposed to mean?
Relax!
She's just kidding!
Sorry sir, they are so noisy.
Don't worry about it.
Would you like a refill?
Okay, another bottle.
I'll get it.
Thanks.
You are the guy who make deliveries every evening, right?
Yes.
I see. You want to open a restaurant.
That's really great, working so hard at such young age.
I'm not really great or anything.
That's right! Say he's "great" after he actually opens a restaurant.
Ahhh!
Niinii! Why did you do that for?
Will you stop hurting me?
You always exaggerate.
Look at this scar!
Niinii knocked me off the stairs when I was little!
Four stitches!
I can see it!
What are you talking about? You fell by yourself.
No, you chased me!
You... Remember it?
I don't, but I do.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means I remember the pain.
How spiteful!
Yes I am, just like you!
Ahh! Wait...
Ahh! What's this?!
Awamori!
A type of Shouchuu (distilled rice liquor)
Whaaa!!
A type of Shouchuu (distilled rice liquor)
Whaaa!!
made only in Okinawa.
Are you stupid?
made only in Okinawa.
Are you okay? Oh, I'm sorry.
Its alcohol content is at least 30%,
Its alcohol content is at least 30%,
Are you okay? I'm sorry.
some reach over 60%.
CONGRATULATIONS
26th Naha North High School Entrance Ceremony
Kaoru! Kaoru!
She's my little sister.
We freshmen will at last begin our long awaited
high school life in Naha North High School.
For three years starting today,
we wish it will become important and
valuable time for all of us.
This first step we have just taken
will be a new phase in our life.
From now, we will start working
toward the goals we made for ourselves.
Niinii, be careful.
Yeah!
Good morning.
Hi, good morning.
Well, auntie, you are even more beautiful than usual!
Yeah right, you didn't even look at my face.
Maybe that's why!
Sorry, Niinii.
What were you trying to do?
Let me see this.
Here you go.
- Youta.
- Yes?
Grill 10 sticks of chicken hearts.
Okay.
Good evening.
Hello.
You doing well?
I'm going to drink again tonight! Beer first.
Coming up!
Thanks.
Is your sister doing well too?
Yes, she's stupid as usual!
Niinii! Why didn't you wake me?
I tried three times, but you didn't wake up.
I'm going.
Hey, you have to finish your breakfast.
- Can't!
- Kaoru!
Will we make it on time?
What?
Will we make it on time?!
I can't hear you!
Ahhh! Just hold on tight!
Yay!
Congratulations!
Thanks for the ride.
Sorry for making you stay so late.
What?
You must be busy with school work.
You have an exam for medical certification next year too.
It doesn't matter. Why are you worrying about me?
It's been a while...
... Since we've been alone together like this..
We are always with the gang lately.
My parents can see us.
Hey! You seem to be working hard!
Ah! Mr. Kameoka.
Oh! I think it will look great when it's done.
All thanks to you.
Here's the documents, before I forget.
Okay, I got it.
Thank you, for doing everything for me.
Don't worry about it.
You remind me of myself when I was young.
What?
I lost my parents when I was young too,
I know how hard it is.
Don't worry. See you again.
Thank you.
Bye.
Thank you for showing me around the campus.
I know you must be busy.
Don't worry about it.
Niinii told me "If you are going to university,
aim for a good one."
But it's still two years in the future.
He always worry so far ahead!
He dropped out of high school,
and always says academic history doesn't matter.
But he says the exact opposite to me!
How is the restaurant coming along?
He's working on it until very late at night.
Keiko,
why does Niinii work so hard?
Of course it's for you.
Youta thinks of himself as a replacement father for you.
That's why I think he wants to start
his own business, so he can support you.
I'm glad his dream came true.
Keiko,
Don't you have plans to get married with Niinii?
What?
I mean, you guys are going out for 4 years now!
You never talk about these things?
Right, now that you mention it... We haven't.
Do you like someone other than Niinii?
What? Why do you ask?
Come on! There must be many better
looking and smarter men around you.
But why Niinii?
Hmm... I wonder why?
Ah! You agreed!
Poor Niinii!!
You said it first!
Don't you know better than anyone else?
Huh?
About what's so wonderful about 'Niinii'.
Niinii!
Hey! What's up?
Got you some food. You will be working
late tonight too, right?
Why all the sudden?
No reason. Love, just love!
This reminds me... Of the restaurant in Kino Bay.
Mom's Taco-rice, it was delicious, wasn't it?
We had so much fun back then, didn't we?
All right, back to work.
Hey Niinii, can I paint this?
Forget it. Your uniform will be ruined.
I don't care!
Okay, everyone gather around.
Over here.
I proudly present...
Tada!
Whoa!!
"Nankuru"?
(Means "It will work out somehow"
(Means "It will work out somehow"
"Nankuru" of "Nankuru-naisaa".
(Means "It will work out somehow"
It will work out somehow, you know!
in heavy Okinawa dialect.)
That is SO Niinii!
in heavy Okinawa dialect.)
- I agree!
- Hey! What did you mean by that?
Stop, guys!
"Nankuru", huh? A formidable competition
for our restaurant.
Yeah, right! Anyway, come on, sit down.
I made these myself too.
What about the staff?
It will be just me for a while.
It will be tough.
It's too expensive to hire staff.
Niinii, I told you I would help out after school.
You don't have to do that.
If you had so much spare time, go study!
Why?
I always tell you.
You are smart, it'd be a waste if
you didn't attend university.
I can get by with just good looks and
physical strength though!
"Good looks"?!
Right, good looks! What? You disagree?
Well, let's just have a toast!
Where's Kei-chan?
She told us to start without her because
she will be late with school work.
Then Youta, go for it!
Okay then.
Uh, as I was introduced earlier...
No one introduced you.
I'm Arakaki Youtarou.
Right, right.
I moved here at age of 16. Now living here for...
We don't care how many years it's been!
Anyway!
Thanks to you guys, I was able to open my own restaurant.
Master chef and Midori.
Thank you so much for teaching me everything I know.
Thank you so much.
I had to get past many obstacles, but...
It's too long!
Drink, drink! Let's hurry and drink!
Cheers!!
Cheers!
Wait, my speech, my...
Thank you, cheers.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Yeah!
I'm sorry, we officially open tomorrow...
What are you people doing here?
Huh?
What happened?
Well... We don't really know either.
That person who claims to be the real owner
of the restaurant came out of nowhere,
and said he never sold his restaurant.
How's that possible?
They said they were planning to tear down
the place and build a new building at the site.
What did Kameoka say?
Kameoka did all the paperwork, right?
About that...
They can't find him.
His company's telephone number isn't being used anymore.
Does that mean...
Youta!
Niinii...
He got me!
I was completely fooled!
Big mistake!
Niinii.
What? Don't surprise me.
Use this.
What is it?
This is the money you have been sending us since you were 16.
Grandma told me she couldn't use it, so she saved them all.
Use it when you get into money trouble, she said.
So...
Why?
This is money sent to you.
Use it when you are in trouble.
Your troubles are my troubles, isn't it?
Am I wrong?
Niinii...
Don't worry! It will work out somehow.
Go to sleep!
You-chan!
I heard about it! Must be tough on you!
I didn't know Kameoka was such a bad guy!
I'm really in trouble! It's because I'm so dumb!
That's why you get fooled by a con artist.
With that face of a fool.
This is a good lesson for you.
Auntie, that's too mean!
Don't you feel sorry for him?
No, it's okay!
She's right, I really was a fool.
Youta, don't be discouraged by this.
If I got discouraged so easily,
I would've been dead long time ago.
Here, use this to cook tonight's dinner.
No, you don't have to, auntie.
It must have taken long time to prepare these bean sprouts.
You can sell these!
Auntie!
Are you Arakaki Youtarou?
Ah, come in.
Please, sit down.
Cold drinks. I'll get you some cold drinks.
That's not necessary.
Don't worry, sit down.
Okay.
I heard everything from Keiko.
Very unfortunate.
Yes.
You don't seem like a bad person, however...
A bit too trusting.
Use this to end your involvement with them.
Is this...
"Business loan" is just a legal name,
they are definitely loan sharks.
Anyway, just use this to get yourself clean.
Uh, but...
Even if you are Kei-chan... I mean...
Miss Keiko's father,
I can't let you...
I can't accept this money.
Eventually...
I plan to have my daughter succeed my hospital.
What are your plans for future?
When you are young, you might think nothing
matters as long as you love each other.
But...
Even if people of different wealth
and environment are together...
A gap will inevitably emerge.
I think sooner or later, such time will come.
Does that mean...
Kei-chan and I are not well matched?
You want me to break up with her for this money?
You may not approve of what I'm doing.
But in my perspective, this is...
Get out!
I don't need your help.
I will take care of this myself.
What makes you think you can...
Please leave!
Niinii.
Dinner's ready.
Let's eat.
It's going to get cold.
It's from Kei-chan.
You sure you won't pick it up?
Youta? It's Keiko.
I know you are in there. Can you open the door?
I need to talk to you, about my father.
I want to talk to you, I want to apologize!
Kaoru.
Can you open the door for me if you are in there?
That's not what I wanted to happen.
Niinii.
That's not why I told him.
I just wanted to help you.
That's all!
Youta, please!
I want to talk to you!
Are you sure? Niinii.
Youta...
Niinii!
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.
I'm sorry...
With your grades now,
Ryukyu's University's Law Department as your first choice is...
Probably no problem.
Really?
Ah! Good for you!
Oh, but you can't let your guard down.
Summer break is the most critical time.
It's still too early to relax.
Okay, I will work hard.
Wait, there's no point for me to work hard, huh?
Work hard, Kaoru.
Teacher, please continue taking good care of her.
Arakaki! Hurry up!
Yes.
Excuse me! I'm getting on!
Huh? Kaoru?
I'm home.
Kaoru, I'm home.
Kaoru, I'm home.
Huh? Oh! Welcome home.
You are early tonight.
What's with you?
Huh?
Your hair is all messed up.
Well, you know...
This question is really hard.
Why does your hair get messy by a hard question?
What a weirdo.
Are your studies going well?
Yes.
Your teacher said summer break is the turning point.
You have to work hard.
Yes...
Hey, Niinii...
About going to university...
I don't think I...
Niinii...
All right, all right, all right. Okay, stop!
Raise it.
I heard from aunties in the marketplace.
You quit delivering?
I can earn more money here.
Everyone was worried about you because
you work until so late at night.
Working hard is my only strength.
Are you still having trouble with the debt?
Kei-chan, it's not something you need to be worried about.
What happened? You surprised me with your sudden visit.
I...
Passed the exam for medical certification.
Really? Good for you!
Congratulations.
I see. That's amazing.
You are a doctor at last.
I still need two years of apprenticeship before
I can become a real doctor.
I'll get you to examine me if I ever get sick.
Sure! Leave it to me.
But I've never even caught a cold before.
I guess I have to force myself to get sick
if I wanted to see you.
Youta, I...
Kei-chan.
I can't see you anymore.
Are you still upset about my father?
No, that's not it.
You will be walking a new path.
Besides, we were so different from beginning.
I felt like you were just forcing yourself to be with me.
Why would you say something like that?
I've never thought of it that way, not even once!
No way! I bet you were the whole time.
It's not good for you to be in relationship with someone like me.
I have to get back to work.
They reduce my pay if I slack off too much.
You were the one...
Who forced yourself to be with me, wasn't it?
I was always lonely.
Ever since Kaoru came.
Things like me becoming a doctor,
or what my father did...
They don't really matter, do they?
If you really loved me,
Those things shouldn't matter, do they?
It matters.
Things like that...
They do matter.
Niinii!
Tada!
Why are you wearing that?
I borrowed it from a friend.
It's a bit small, but
What do you think?
Pretty good...
Let's go, before it's over.
Look over there! It's Yuuichi.
- Huh? Where?
- Right there!
Oh, I see him!
There.
Hey.
Hey!
Whoa!
Are you stupid? Staring at your sister as if you are lost in love.
No! Don't be ridiculous.
Well, she did became really beautiful lately.
Did she?
Yes.
Ah!
What?
Ow, ow!
What's with this "part time job"?
Explain it to Niinii!
Explain?
I... Just wanted to help you out a little bit...
Do you know how important it is right now for you?
But...
I thought you would be angry if I told you the truth.
Of course!
Why is a student about to take the
university entrance exam doing something like that?
Tell me!
Niinii...
What?
Why are you so concerned about university?
I don't know why you want me to go
to university so badly.
I don't care if I drop out of high school right now.
What kind of nonsense is that?
Who do you think I work so hard for?!
That's what bothers me!
It bothers me too see you like that.
Always saying "it's for you", "its for you."
If you like university so much, why don't you go?
Could you stop pushing your dream on me?
What did you say?!
You always say academic history doesn't matter,
but it bothers you more than anyone else!
You broke up with Kei-chan because of it too!
I'm your younger sister.
What's wrong with a younger sister trying
to help an older brother?
I don't want to go to university if it causes
you so much trouble.
I'm not a kid anymore. I can think for myself!
That's why...
You should think a little for yourself.
Not working day and night...
Not always for me...
You should just live the way you like, for yourself!
Stupid Niinii!
Where did you go?
Coming back so late.
Niinii.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
She passed!
Students must pass the entrance exam
Auntie she passed! It's Ryukyus!
for that university to be accepted.
It's not like you passed it.
You are right.
You-chan!
Congratulations, take this.
Thank you.
You-chan! As a celebration! Take these!
Good for you! Take these too.
Thank you!
Thank you, thanks, all of you.
Kaoru, you just wait.
Niinii will make really delicious dinner for you.
Ah, we have to have a toast first!
You are an university student now, you can drink!
But you sure are amazing.
As expected of you, Kaoru.
My debt is paid off too. This is going to be a good year!
Niinii. There's something I want to talk to you about.
Hold on, I'll prepare for the toast right now.
I want to talk to you about this before we do that.
Just wait for a little while, it won't take long.
Niinii, I'm leaving this house.
Huh?
I was thinking about it for a while.
The room is small, and I'm already an university student.
It's more convenient if I found a place near the campus.
How will you pay for it?
Don't worry about the money. It can pay for it somehow.
How?
It seems I can get scholarship, and I can work part time too.
Why, all the sudden?
Not all the sudden...
It's something I've been thinking for quite a while.
If the room is too small,
we can move to a bigger place together.
I was thinking this place was starting to get unbearable too.
Actually, it's more than unbearable from beginning, huh?
I like you, Niinii.
What are you saying?
It's about time I...
... Get away from you, and live by myself.
Why?
Why?
There is no reason.
Just... I'm an adult now.
I graduated from high school too.
That's all.
It has to be a man!
A man?!
There must be a man she likes!
Kaoru is already 18, right?
It wouldn't be strange for her to have a boyfriend.
Right?
More like, it's strange she didn't have one until now.
Hey, You-chan,
don't tell me you thought she didn't have any experiences before.
"Experiences"?
She's 18. She has a 'nice body'.
This is Okinawa!
Ah! With a Niinii like this, I can see why she wants to leave.
Actually...
It's me.
I'm her boyfriend.
I'm sorry!
Why you...!
Just kidding!
Got ya!
I got you there!
It's hard for me to tell you this...
But I heard of this strange rumor...
Rumor, just a rumor.
It's not like I saw it myself.
Why are you explaining it to me?
What is it? Master chef?
You know there's an old jazz club called 'Hideaway'?
It seems she was seeing a middle-aged man there.
Who?
Who?...
Kaoru.
It wasn't me.
She was the one who found me.
I was shocked! I didn't recognize her at first.
You never know what a woman is thinking.
Scary, huh?
Where were you until now?
I returned here around a year ago.
Until then... Well, I was wandering around.
Mitsue.
I heard she passed away.
She was a good-tempered, kind woman.
I told Kaoru...
She should be grateful to you and Mitsue.
You raised her even though she's not related by blood.
You looked after her until she's a full adult.
She's been under your care the whole time.
I told her she should set you free.
And... What did Kaoru say?
What did she say?
About what?
After what she heard what you said! About you!
She didn't say anything.
Why did you tell her?
Why not?
I said why did you tell her?!
It's the truth.
Do you still call yourself a father?
A father?
Do you know?
How hard it was for mom, for Kaoru... After you left?
Youta.
Kaoru became a fine woman.
Thanks for taking care of her until now.
Where did you get that wound?
Niinii?
Kaoru.
You go live on your own.
What?
You should. It's for your own good.
From that spot across the TV,
where you used to live
As I sit down, the evening moon rises
beyond the window.
If I can sing happiness and sadness someday,
It lies under this Island's soil,
Kaoru, hurry and eat. It's getting cold.
Okay.
Crying during fall, enduring through the winter,
Flower of Sanshin blooms in spring.
Let's eat.
Neither this sky, or that ocean will tell us a story
Its resonance turns into warm wind,
summons rain onto this island
It was Flower of Sanshin that bloomed.
Kaoru.
Take this with you.
Why? This is...
Just take it.
What if I lose it?
I'll kill you if you lost it!
Fine, I'll keep it.
Take care.
Niinii...
It's not like we are separating for life.
We can meet anytime we want to.
Right.
Niinii.
Hmm?
I like you a lot, Niinii.
I love you.
Are you stupid?
Hurry and go.
Okay.
Good bye, Niinii.
Niinii!
Thank you for having me under your care for so long.
This play depicts a nation's great accomplishments.
Of course, Shakespeare is an English poet, so you can say
he is a poet who expressed the honor and pride of England.
What do you want to do?
Let's all work together!
Good idea!
When does your club activity start?
Around three.
Okay, I'll call you later then.
Bye.
Bye.
Guide to Coming-of-Age Ceremony.
Every year ceremonies organized by
local governments are held for young adults
who reached age of 20 on 2nd Monday of January.
From: Arakaki Kaoru
Niinii, how are you?
I am doing well, and attending the university.
I'm sorry for not even writing you for such long time.
It's already a year and half since then.
Time really flew by.
I'm almost 20 years old.
I will be attending Coming-of-Age Ceremony
on the Island next year.
Niinii, there's no point keeping it from you now,
so I will tell you the truth.
When I met him, when I met my father,
somewhere in my mind, it still made me happy.
He was an unreliable person who abandoned mom and I,
but it still made me happy to find out that my father is alive,
and that he was right in front of me.
But you know,
I couldn't think of him as family no matter how hard I tried.
Because...
I don't have a single memory of being loved by him.
After splitting with you,
I realized once again that I was protected by you the whole time.
To me, Niinii is still the most important person to me.
You are my family, the person I can't live without.
Please don't forget that.
Do you have any plans for New Year's holidays coming up?
I think I will return to the Island, to say thanks to grandma
and everyone else for raising me to this day.
I hope I can see you there too.
I hope I can see you, and I hope we can talk again.
Please take care and good luck with your work.
I am praying from the bottom of my heart
that your dream will come true.
- Kaoru.
You change is 100 Yen. Thank you.
Very large and extremely intense typhoon number 28 is
located west of Okinawa, and advancing north.
Kerama and Aguri islands are within the range of this typhoon.
It is very rare for typhoon to approach
the prefecture of Okinawa on December,
This will be the first time in 21 years, since 1984.
At the present moment, typhoon's central pressure
is decreasing at an alarming rate,
increasing intensity and approaching towards the Main Islands.
Ahhh!
Kaoru! It's me!
Are you okay? Are you hurt?
It's okay now.
Wait here.
Kaoru! Take important belongings to the back
so they don't get soaked!
There are glass shards lying around everywhere,
so be careful!
Bring one more sliding door here, Kaoru!
Hurry! It's going to get soaked!
Here.
I'll use this, okay?
Hold it.
Get something to stuff in between.
Hurry!
Use this!
Thank you, Niinii.
I don't know what I would've done without you.
I'll get you change of clothes right away.
What's wrong? Niinii?
Are you okay?
You have a really high fever. Let's go see a doctor.
- We can make it to a hospital near by...
- Don't worry.
Fever will go away after a good night's sleep.
But...
I'm fine. Don't worry.
Why?
Why did you come? When you have such a high fever.
I thought I heard someone crying.
Crying?
For some reason,
It felt like you were crying.
That's why...
I made a promise... With mom.
Niinii...
Are you okay? Niinii?
Are you okay?
You are not fine. I'm calling a doctor.
Who can I get on a day like this?
Niinii, they are coming soon.
The ambulance is coming now.
I'm...
So lame.
What?
I was supposed to come save you...
What am I doing?
Niinii...
I'm really pathetic...
Niinii.
I wanted to see you the whole time.
Ever since I left you, I wanted to see you every single day..
What are you talking about?
You were the one who wanted to leave.
You are right.
You are right...
Niinii, I...
Actually knew...
That Niinii...
Is not my real brother.
What?
That day we first met...
I still remember it to this day.
But...
I had a feeling you would disappear from me,
right in front of my eyes...
If I told you the truth.
I was scared of being alone.
That's why I...
Pretended to not know about it.
I'm sorry, Niinii.
I'm sorry.
Kaoru...
Kaoru!
Keiko!
We are already prepared for medical examination.
Thank you.
Youta?
Kei-chan.
Please move him in.
"Inflammatory heart disease"?
The flu virus reached his heart,
caused inflammation in the heart, and his heart rate
is slowing down as a result.
His blood sample shows a high rate of inflammation,
and his nutrition condition is poor as well.
It seems his immune systems was weakening even before this.
Was your older brother working excessively?
It is necessary for him to rest and recuperate.
Let's have him stay in the hospital for few days,
and check on his progress.
Yes.
Thank you.
I was surprised.
Youta, of all people gets sick...
Why did you leave him unattended until it got this bad?
Keiko,
I'm living separately with Niinii right now.
Ever since I got into the university.
It has really been a long time since I met him... Today.
I see.
Kaoru.
I'm leaving Okinawa soon.
What?
I decided to work at a hospital at the mainland.
I see.
I was thinking I'd never see you two again.
Isn't it strange?
That's when I got the phone call... From you.
Doctor Minamine,
Arakaki's condition has suddenly worsened in room 645!
Please come.
Yes.
What happened?
It became bloody all the sudden. A total AV block.
Get the defibrillator ready.
Youta, Youta!
Keiko, what will happen to my brother?
- What's the saturation?
- 80.
- Prepare for intubation.
- Yes.
Family member, excuse me.
Blood pressure?
Undetectable.
Niinii...
Niinii.
Niinii!!!
"Naakunii" - An Okinawan folk song sang
with Sanshin. Lyric usually made up freely by
the singer for each occasion. The first
three verses of this version is the official lyric.
It happened in the past,
But the emotions still burn within me
How can I forget your kindness to me?
My sadness
Is taller than the mountain and deeper than the sea...
Kaoru.
What are you doing at a place like this?
Grandma...
Where did Niinii go?
I still can't believe...
That Niinii is gone.
Kaoru.
When grandma was your age,
The person I loved most went to war,
and died.
I was sad and filled with regret.
I cried and cried, but my tears never ceased.
But you know,
Eventually grandma got married,
a daughter was born,
then you grandchildren were born,
and lived a long life.
People have...
Long lives and...
Short lives.
There are many kinds of lives.
25 years must have been...
...His lifespan.
It can't be helped.
Kaoru.
You don't have to hold it. It's okay to cry.
When you are sad,
it's okay to cry as much as you want!
But you know.
Niinii passed away, but he still exists.
At a place far far, endlessly far south beyond this Island,
The man grandma loved, your grandfather, your mother too...
And Niinii too...
They are all there...
They all live happily together.
Thank you for everything.
Kaoru,
If you ever have any problems, feel free to visit us any time.
Yes.
Grandma, don't worry. It will be fine.
Miss Arakaki.
A package for Ms. Arakaki Kaoru.
Ah, yes.
Dear Arakaki Kaoru.
Congratulations on Coming-of-Age!
You are 20 years old at last!
I couldn't do anything for you until now, but I'm sending you a Kimono to commemorate this occasion.
I'm sure it will look good on you.
No, I'm sure you will look more beautiful than anyone else there!
Your letter made me think about many things.
I am planning to come back to the Island during your Coming-of-Age Ceremony.
Like you said,
I have to be grateful to grandma and others on the Island too.
Let's have a drink together when the time comes!
And also talk about many things!
I will work hard as I eagerly await that day.
And one day, I will open a huge restaurant for sure!
Just kidding.
Take care of your health,
and study hard.
From Niinii.
Niinii...
Niinii...
Niinii.
Niinii.
Niinii!
Niinii!!!
Niinii!!!
I whispered "Thank you" while turning 
the pages of the old photo album
Always, always in my heart,
 a person who encourages me
On any days, clear sky or raining,
that same smile emerges on your face
Even when my memories of you fades away,
I would search through my mind again,
And on days when I recall you in my memories,
 tears flow endlessly
Wishing to the stars to be with you again,
 this has become my new habit
When I look up to the sky during sunset,
 I'm searching for you in my mind
Whenever I'm feeling sad or happy,
 I recall that smile
If you can see me from where you are now,
I will believe we will meet again someday,
 and go on with my life
On any days, clear sky or raining,
that same smile emerges on your face
Even when my memories of you fades away,
I'll be lonely, I'll be missing you
Still have feelings left for you,
 Tears flowing endlessly
I want to see you,
 I want to see you
Still have feelings left for you,
tears flowing endlessly
Niinii.
Kaoru will...
When Kaoru grows up, I'll be your bride!
Can't I?
Of course not!
Why?
Are you stupid? You don't know?
Huh?
Brothers and sisters can't get married.
Why not?
Hmm... Hmm... I don't know.
Why not?
I don't know.
Why not?!
I don't know!
