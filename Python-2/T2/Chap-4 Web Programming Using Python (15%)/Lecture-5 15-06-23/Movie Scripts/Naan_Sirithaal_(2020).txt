In 1995, a gang war broke
out in Poonamallee, Chennai
Dayalan, who ruled over that
place for long was the target
Many tried to finish him
off and take his place
But none of them could even near Dayalan
The reason? His friends; his sidekicks
Dilli Babu and Sakkara Das
When the gang war ended Dayalan
proved that he is king of Poonamallee
To celebrate that victory, he arranged
a party and invited every gangsters
During that party, when Dilli
committed a silly mistake
Dayalan embarrassed him in
front of the whole crowd
Everyone laughed at Dilli






Dilli snapped and couldn't
control his anger
He took out a knife and
stabbed Dayalan on the spot!
Everyone, who were laughing,
were taken aback!
This news spread like a wildfire
everywhere on the same night
At sunrise Poonamallee had a
new king and it was Dillibabu
Instead being a friend to Dilli,
Sakkara Das wanted to become the king
And so he planned to finish off Dilli
Today, even after 25 years and many
attempts still Dilli was unstoppable
Dilli helped those in power by
committing murders for them
He became even more powerful
- Long live! Long live!
- Minister Thangadurai!
- Long live! Long live!
- Minister Thangadurai!
Dilli...
here's the details of a person






Snatch our hard disk
that he possess
I'll collect it from
you when I find time
Until then you have it
Now that you've handed the
task over to me., don't worry
That hard disk is very important
If data in it leaks, it'll
topple our government
So you mean the government is
now at the behest of me, Dilli?
Our plight!
After Paul Raj, Sakkara predicted that
he would Dilli Babu's next target
So he started making plans
in order to over take Dilli
Soon we must print a obituary
poster like this for Dilli
We must finish him off
Wait
Whom will you hire to finish him?
Say he is the target and it'll scare
the bejesus out of every hitman!
We shouldn't do it
But we must get it done
One who finishes him off...
must be a guy who is always around us
But...
someone who doesn't know about Dilli
So to put an end to this game of cards
filled with Jacks, Kings and Aces...
came along a Joker!
(Supernatural Human Beings)
Greetings and a very
warm welcome to the show...
Supernatural Human Beings
Liew Thow Lin from Malaysia...
had magnetic qualities in his body
Michel Lotito from France...
ate a whole aeroplane by biting
and chewing it with his teeth
Natasha Demkina from Russia...
could take X- rays
using her naked eyes
In fact...
Raj Mohan Nair from our country...
generated electricity from his
body and lighted up a bulb!
So many such Supernatural humans
live in this world of ours
Based on that, people with unique qualities
and super natural powers from our place...
are the ones we will be
meeting in this show!
I am very curious to know about your son
Tell us about him
My son is a very soft person, madam
How do I put it...He is very emotional type
Even if his favorite star
gets beaten up in a movie...
Dad!
Dear, what happened? Why are you crying?
Asin died without finding out the
fact that Surya is Sanjay Ramasamy!
It's a movie! Asin would have
gone home after the shooting
Tell him dear wifey!
Especially when it
comes to friendship...
Friends are his life!
He will do anything for his friends
I'm Thiyagu from Mahalakshmi, Poonamallee
Myself, Gandhi, Mani...
and Dillibabu! We all
are childhood friends
Gandhi will rush to help anyone
and everyone who needs help
You played with us and now you're busted!
Embarrassed?
- Shut up! We just dated, right?
- Of course!
Then stop showing off as I cheated
you after we got married!
One punch and....Stop talking
as if you're innocent!
Oh my God! My stomach hurts!
Sister, do you feel feverish?
- Come on! I am here to help you, sister
- Dude, she is acting!
- Will he come back?
- Who's that emotional fellow?
- I'll take care of you
- It's ok, brother!
Money...here take it. Here!
In the name of solving one issue
he'll tag us to another big one
She cheated me for 4 years
and him for 2 years
We just busted her, caught her
and your friend spoiled it!
Is he your friend?
Worst!
Gandhi would the first person to help
anyone in the office,who calls out for help
In these modern days when people
hardly do their own work...
He helps other and does their job too
Wondering that all that we
heard so far was just normal?
Wondering what's so
supernatural about it?
The supernatural qualities
of our guest today...
Let's find it out from him
Sounds interesting, isn't it?
Let's welcome Gandhi on our show, today
Come on, let's clap everybody!
Hi
Greetings. Please have a seat
Greetings
So Gandhi...
before this supernatural
quality found you...
what was the biggest
issue in your life?
Of course it was my love life!
Just like everyone else, I was an
engineering graduate who worked in I.T
So, in the HR department of our office...
there was this girl named Ankita!
Her eyes...
"Your eyes and the way its speak, makes
you look like an angel on earth"
"So baby, allow me and I will
follow you back and forth"
"Apple like cheeks that shine so bright"
"Smile so cute! Oh my, what a sight"
"Mesmerizing voice that attracts me!
I tell myself 'Stop being so crazy'!"
"A queen on the golden chariot"
"She lights up my whole world"
"A flower must have scent and a
gentleman should have good qualities'
"So be the daughter of such a
gentleman and have a good reputation"
Everyone's watching!
Can you or can you not?
You! Look at her!
Like a pot head hit a jackpot!
Look how beautiful she is
She is way out of you league! Just do it!
But if people find out...
Well, then it'd be a proud
moment for the 90s kids!
Just do it! Do it!
I did it
I love you
"You smile is never a lie and
whatever you say is just fine"
"You are my love life
and soon to be my wife"
"A thousand of butterflies in my
stomach and they make me fly high"
"Blindly in love, I'm hypnotised"
"I follow you everywhere you go"
"All I want is you and that is all I know"
"I will do just about
anything for you"
"Love is beyond science and a
feeling that is always new"
"She is a sweetheart"
"The girl who stole my heart"
"Let me hold your hand"
"And live forever in our love land"
"I follow you everywhere you go"
"I will gift myself to you"
"A queen on the golden chariot"
"She lights up my whole world"
What are you telling, Ankita?
We have already fixed a groom for you
- Well...
- You know about our financial status!
There is a lot of difference
between his and our family!
Game over?
Please dad!
You have a good job
That is the sole reason I'm considering you
If not for that job I'd have
asked to you forget Ankita
I'll talk to your parents someday
Let's see if things can work out
Guys...
We are happy to inaugurate
our soft skills program...
in front of our executive
officer, Mr. Peter Wilson
In this soft skill program,
learning Hindi is mandatory
What? Why are they imposing it on us?
Everyone must attend this class
for an hour after your work hours
Don't you always talk like a rebel. Here
is another chance, speak up and save us!
Why would I knowingly invite trouble?
Whom can I tag instead of me?
I know one guy
He is a specialist!
He will rock it!
Here he is!
Here comes my slave!
Welcome my braveheart!
Hi
Sorry, I'm a bit late
That's ok
At the right time you will
reach the right place!
Which I.T company forces their
employees to learn Hindi?
But our company is making us do it
Look what the society says...
'Hear you inner voice? Raise you voice!'
- Protest against injustice!
- No, please. No
- No! No! Sir!
- Get up!
Uh-oh! I'm trapped!
Yes Gandhi?
Sir...
why do we have to impose anything sir?
Let people learn what they want to learn
Wow! Wow!
Excuse me! My training!
Mr Gandhi...
we have our branches in
Delhi and Mumbai as well
Sir but our clients are in
New York and New Jersey!
Nailed it! Nailed it! You rock, buddy!
You!
Gandhi, have a seat.
First, have a seat
Give him some water
I have one more point to make
Sir, it seems he has one more point to make
Make!
- Sir, I come to conclusion
- Conclusion!
Stupid!
Instead of learning 1 regional
language from 5:30 to 6:30...
we can actually learn 2 programming
languages from 5:30 to 7:30!
It'll actually be helpful, sir
Sit down!
He makes sense
Yes
Ankita...
please email me Gandhi's profile
Err.. Ok, Patel
Sir, he's innocent. He's
a very good resource
- Do what I say
- Yes, sir
This one?
- It's quiet simple
- Then you do it
Ok
Can't you just keep your mouth shut?
What happened, Ankita?
Morning, I was asked to email your profile
Manager wants to meet you
Now, go!
I'm nervous, Ankita
Weren't you nervous to play
a rebel on other's orders?
Girlfriend - A dangerous species!
Ok! Stop making that sad face
Now go with this smiling face
and meet the manager. Ok?
Won't be that bad. Ok?
My profile is that bad!
All the best
We are screening few employees this year
Since you haven't completed your
degree, your name has come up
Isn't the exams to clear
you backlogs coming up?
Clear off your backlogs
You should've cleared them during training
period. How could you be so careless, Gandhi?
Why are you quiet?
My exam is tomorrow, Ankita
What?
Fine...
go home and start preparing right away. Ok?
I just can't imagine
a future without you
What if you screw up in this exam?
Then things will go out
of my control, Gandhi
Really?
So call me and tell that you
did this exam well. Ok?
I'll be waiting for your call
Ok?
Come on
So which subject do you have a backlog in?
DSP - Digital Signal Processing
alias Degree Stopping Paper!
5 units in total
Definitely the exam paper will have 2 2marks
and 1 16 mark question from each unit
It's be enough if I cover these topics...
I can score minimum 80
marks and rock this exam!
It's a simple exam. Why
strain yourself so much?
Simple exam? How can you
be so cool about it?
It's an Engineering exam!
Right from childhood the word 'exam'
sends a shiver down my spine!
I haven't even covered
the 1st unit, oh God!
Mr. Manoj!
- Hello
- Hello, Mr. Gandhi...
- What?
- Indeed! So many mistakes!
That pot head Patel ripped me apart!
He asked me if I was really a software
engineer or a server in Saravana Bhavan!
- Wait, I'll call you later
- Before that please place your order!
Hello, Anki...
So, this is how you study for exam?
Whom were talking to?
My friend called me up
So, I don't matter to you?
Come on, baby. Nothing of that sort...
Gandhi, you don't seem to be serious.
You're still playful!
What's more important
than preparing for exam?
If you lose your job, how
will we run a family?
Already my family has a debt of 5 million!
We are pushed to sell our
land and clear the debt
If you don't get your degree,
they won't agree for our marriage
Did I say anything wrong?
No, Anki...
Fine. Don't break your head over
all these and focus on studying
We'll talk later
Bye
Don't break my head and study?
How can I study after hearing all that?
The time is just 10 'O clock...
So, I shall finish studying
the 2nd unit in 2 hours
Attend 3 16 marks question and...
Ok!
Ok, worst come I can at least pass
Let's do this!
Why? Why!
Mom...
I have got an exam tomorrow morning.
I've set the alarm
I must wake up at 6
- If I don't wake up, please wake me up
- Ok
I'll wake you
- Dear, it's me, the shop owner. Please, wake up
- Come on, who's troubling me so early!
- Please dear, just wake up
- No way!
God!
God!
Mom, thanks for screwing it all up!
Enough! Now, look at me and howl once!
Mom!
Told you to wake me up at 6!
You work so hard at office and I
noticed you were having a sound sleep
Didn't feel like waking
you up from a sound sleep
Uh-oh! A flat tyre?
- Hi dude
- Hi
Good morning
What's up, senior?
Your last chance. Looks like
you have prepared very well
What did he mean by 'Last chance?'
Indeed dude. If we don't clear it this
time then we don't get another chance
What do you mean?
Gandhi...
Wait!
Why are you so upset?
Obvious isn't it? If I fail
this exam then I'll lose my job
If I lose my job I'll lose my girlfriend.
If my girlfriend leave me then my life?
It is at such tough times, like this,
you must not lose confidence, Gandhi!
Such testing times means only one thing!
- It means only one thing!
- What's that?
It means something really good
and big is going to happen
Wait and watch, soon you dull
face will turn real bright!
Starting today, your life is
going to touch new heights!
Gandhi...
please help me in the exam if you
know any of the answers. Ok?
- Sir?
- Id!
Bro, got an eraser?
Here
Bro...
attending backlogs for a longtime?
Sorry, sir
What is it?
Pot head!
That was the very second my life changed!
You have a good job
- That is the sole reason I'm considering you
- What if you screw up in this exam?
If you lose your job, how
will we run a family?
Such testing times means only one thing!
- You have good job
- What if you screw up?
'Last chance?'
Already my family has a debt of 5 million!
Such testing times means only one thing!
Did I say anything wrong?
Title: NAAN SIRITHAL
(And when I laugh...)
Dude...
The topper is crying here but look at
Gandhi, who is here to clear backlog?
Dude!
Paper turned out as you expected?
We are gonna clear this exam, get ready
for marriage, set out lives and rock!
Now, tell me the answers
First 2 mark answers
Option A?
B?
Dude, say it properly!
My marriage
Come out, I'll split
your head open!
There was no fear in his eyes
The whole department is in shock!
A guy who is not intimidated
by that 16 mark question
He ain't a normal person!
Impossible!
Interesting!
You break out into a laughter
when you become sad?
So, what happens when you're happy?
I won't feel like laughing
Because my heart is full of sorrows
Of late I am unable to laugh
when someone cracks a good joke.
Is he laughing or crying?
Let's do a test
How about I crack a good joke?
Come here
Good joke!
You laughed!
You laughed! What else do you need?
Treatment ok!
I didn't find it funny!
Your joke wasn't funny at all, doctor!
I am laughing because
I'm sad, doctor!
Compose!
Compose!
Gandhi!
You have a condition called...
Nervous Laughter!
Sorrow, stress, fear and pain...
in such times, you will break in to
laughter without your knowledge!
Am I correct?
Yes doctor!
Gandhi, hear me out carefully
- Ok
- Don't panic!
Such emotions are very powerful!
Controlling your emotions...
with pills or medicines is impossible!
You will have to control
your mind to stop this
Now what do I do doctor?
Control yourself, Gandhi!
Nothing an be done
Only cure for this condition
is for it to fade away in time
Oh God! That's her...
Wonder why she is calling
Will she ask me how I did the exam?
How did the exam go?
Well...
Why are you quiet?
- Hello
- Sorry, Ankita
Sorry? Screwed it up?
If you fail this exam, you'll lose your job
My family won't agree to our
wedding if you don't have a job
Yet you screw it up. So you
just don't care, right?
- Well, Anki..
- Stop!
Forget it, Gandhi
It's over
Let's break up
I was at Ganesh's house
roof to cut cake for him
Exactly at midnight, I heard a laughter
I checked and it was...
What is gong on?
How could you leave you only son
alone in the terrace at night?
Paulraj, who resided in the 2nd street
The Late. Paulraj!
Dear...
it sounded exactly like his laughter!
Take your son to Veerabadhran
temple and perform exorcism on him
Ok
Lord Veerabadhra! Come on, bless us!
Bless us!
Lord Veerabadhra! Come on, bless us!
Bless us!
This is taken from the Lord's wrist
Priest, don't you have a brand new one?
This is powerful! You shouldn't
remove it for 6months
Until it's tied to your wrist,
no evil spirit will near you!
What if it unties?
Quiet, dad!
If it unties, then from
the very next minute...
you will find yourself in danger!
You'll come across many wrong people!
Your life will be in danger!
I have conveyed your problems
to Lord Veerabadhran!
He'll take care of you!
Until this vow is complete, you
must not tell about it to anyone!
Understood?
What happened?
This is his problem. He keeps laughing!
Gandhi, just tell him if you any problems
"Come on, buddy! Look around!"
"Nothing is mine or yours or
anyone's for that matter!"
"Come on, buddy! Look around!"
"Nothing is mine or yours or
anyone's for that matter!"
"She said "Let's break up"
but what's my fault?"
"For no fault of mine, she
called me a baddie villain"
"That electrocuted me and my heart"
"I am burnt to ashes and
time to press 'restart'"
"She asked me to get lost and go die!"
"I ask God 'Why me? Why?'"
"She wants me gone! She wants me dead!"
"But I got my buddies to
keep me moving ahead"
"Let me tell you why my heart aches"
"She changed her status to
"Single" and that's all it takes"
"I am depressed and I
cannot take it anymore"
"Knowing that my photo is
not her wallpaper anymore!"
"She said 'Let's break up!'"
"She told me 'Let's break up!'"
"She said 'Let's break up!'"
"She told me 'Let's break up!'"
"I have this laughing condition, I can't
show my emotion and I laugh in depression"
"My life is screwed, so is love.
Now, I laugh in confusion"
"I can't even say it out and
so I hid it in delusion"
"Problems are all I have and
laugh is only solution"
"I now laugh to forget my love"
"I now laugh to forget my girl"
"I now laugh thinking about
how my life in danger"
"I now laugh to beat the anger"
"Let me tell you why my heart aches"
"She changed her status to
"Single" and that's all it takes"
"I am depressed and I
cannot take it anymore"
"Knowing that my photo is
not her wallpaper anymore!"
"She said 'Let's break up!'"
"She told me 'Let's break up!'"
"She said 'Let's break up!'"
"She told me 'Let's break up!'"
"My love life is over
and life in down low"
"I have lost control and
going I am going crazy now!"
A vow for 6 months
The priest asked me to
keep the vow a secret
Let me tell you how I
struggled those 6 months
What struggles did
you go through?
May 1st!
Labour's day
Thala Ajith Kumar's birthday!
I went for the screening of fans' show
The one person I hate the
most in this world...
is my father!
When my friends ask me about him...
I feel like crying
Excuse me!
His legs are longer and taller than him!
Now listen to me!
Take the kid and go to the ground!
How dare you?
Been noticing you
since beginning!
How dare you laugh and
mock at emotional scenes?
You must be a Vijay fan!
Nothing like that. I
watch every star's movie
Now, listen! Watch it for
our star Thala's hardwork!
Do you know who I am?
'Mankatha' Mahesh!
'Dheena' Dhayal!
'Red' Kannan!
Ball! 'Vaali' Ball!
Is that even a name?
This is your last warning!
Laugh and you'll see
stars around your head!
No!
I think they mistook it as our star
You'll be a goner!
Why are you punching from behind?
The same is happening to
our star in the fight!
But nothing will happen to him.
I know!
How emotional!
Can you call me out once
Father!
My dear!
You are a goner!
Hit him!
22nd June
Wait, I know
World Chocolate day!
'Thalapathy' Vijay's birthday!
Right!
I went for fans' screening
for his movie too
Really?
The last life to be lost
in this hospital...
should be my life
Come on, don't say so
Boss!
You shouldn't laugh at that scene!
Ok, brother
Buddy, patience
Guys, I swear I am
touched by the scene
I am not allowed to say
why I laugh like this
Lord Veerabadhra, please
ensure I reach home safe
What have you guys done?
How dare you?
Mocking, are you?
You must be an Ajith fan!
Believe me, no...
Aren't you the guy who trolls
our star with memes in Facebook
Brother, I am a neutral guy
Neutral? Where do hear that word often?
In bike gear
- Who is known for bike racing?
- Thala! (My Head!)
See that? He said it himself!
That he is a 'Thala' Ajith fan
Dear hardcore fan, there is no
logic at all in your judgment!
Guys, he just said that there is
no logic in our star's movie!
Amsa, bring the coffee
Wondering why I brought my parents to your
home after telling you "Lets break up"
I have talked a great deal
about you to my parents
So, keep a smiling
face like this
Don't speak and screw things up
Ok? Come on
Uh-oh! Wonder what's gonna happen now
Lord Veerabadhra! Save me!
Sir, have some chips
No thanks
Fine, I'll have some
Gandhi?
Own house
Team lead in an IT company
And a monthly salary of 0.1 million.
My daughter told me
So...
I see it's quite conjested outside
your home. Where do you park the car?
Car?
He's talking about your car!
Didn't you tell me that kids play and hit
the ball on it. Hence you parked it away
Car! Our car!
The crows crap on it. The
neighbour's son pees on it
We are tired of washing it.
Also very little space here
So parked at a friend's place nearby.
There's lot of space there. Right?
Ankita...
won't it be too sultry
here during summer?
Yes, sir!
But...Winter is coming!
See I quoted the 'Game of thrones'
So, you just hold a B.E degree...
- Or anything more?
- Well...
I hear that he has written the
CAT or GRE exam. Isn't it?
He cleared GRE, mom
Soon he'll go abroad
Abroad?
He is very "bookish" like that
Also...
something else too...
Not getting it
Something else?
Wonder what else she told him
- Coffee!
- Coffee!
Coffee!
- Coffee
- Please have
So, how did you write the exam, Gandhi?
He has done it really well
He will clear all his backlogs this time!
Look what you did
Dad...
Napkin
I had kept it here
Sir
Wipe your face
Give it to mom
Why would you do that, dad?
Backlogs?
Don't you worry!
My son will become an engineer soon
He is a responsible boy
He wouldn't want to lose his job. Else how
will he repay the bike loan and house rent?
Gandhi, let's run!
- Bike loan?
- Of course!
I can't believe this!
- House rent?
- Yes!
- Why are you laughing?
- Gandhi!
Why are you even laughing?
What's going on?
Are you insulting my father?
Gandhi, now quiet!
Are you guys insulting us?
Not at all
Sir...
Gandhi...
Gandhi!
I am furious and you're
laughing like crazy?
Sir please...
"It looks like I am laughing all the time"
"I swear I am not! Not this time!"
"What if I tell you that I feel so grey?"
"Why does that make you stare
at me in a strange way?"
"It might look like I am laughing"
"But I swear I am not laughing"
"What if I tell you that I feel so grey?"
"Why does that make you stare
at me in a strange way?"
Get lost!
My foot!
"Life is mocking and laughing at me"
"Life is mocking and laughing at me"
"Oh yeah, it is laughing at me"
"Oh God! Fine! Laugh! Laugh all you want"
"Laugh your way to glory!"
"To those laughing on me;
I laugh back at you"
"To those laughing on me;
I laugh back at you"
"Yes, I am laughing at you"
" I am laughing at you"
" I am laughing at you"
"In happiness and sorry, keep laughing"
"No matter what happens, we will face it.
So keep laughing"
"During tough times, keep laughing"
"Keep laughing"
"No matter what happens, we will face it.
So keep laughing"
"Life is mocking and laughing at me"
"Life is mocking and laughing at me"
"My love life..."
"My life..."
"Day and night...."
"This is my fight..."
"And when I laugh..."
"an earthquake occurs and
the Lord will shiver"
"Every living being will run away in fear"
Couples who made a Tik Tok video on rail line
where killed when a train rammed them down
"My life..."
"Day and Night..."
Gandhi, please. Stop laughing
Our son's laughing!
- He's laughing!
- Dad's crying!
- He's laughing!
- Dad's crying, mom!
Alright!
I somehow managed to cross 5
months and almost the 6th one
But the last one week...
It took the life out of me!
Why? What happened?
We have so many friends from our school
days to our current working place
But friends who grow up with us from
childhood, in the same locality...
Definitely we'll have
one such special friend
We'd hang out with him all the time
But out of the blue he'll
fall in love and forget us
Yet, we'll wish him happiness
no matter where he is
And we'll move on with our work
Suddenly if an issue pops
up in his love life and...
if he goes missing, how'd
you react to that?
My friend Dillibabu went missing
If my husband was alive, at least he
could go around, inquire and find him
Where will I look for him?
Whom can I ask to help me?
Come on, please don't feel so bad
We are here for you as your sons
You just calm down and relax
Call me if you see Dilli
We inquired all around our area
in our pursuit to find Dillibabu
- But none of them saw him
- Did Babu come there?
We tried to get the details
of his girlfriend at least
But we had no luck
Hand over the hard disk to
the minister after the party
Ok, boss
- Invited everyone?
- Yes, boss
'Court' Mariappan?
- Alphonse?
- Invited, boss
- Triplicane Afsal
- Invited, boss
Did you invite Sakkara Das?
I did, boss but looks
like he is out of station
His men will come for the party
He's a nothing!
He'll definitely sketch out
a plan to finish me off
Today's Dilli Babu's birthday right?
Last year my birthday was
celebrated like a festival!
That made him jealous
Boss, he hardly has any good henchmen
We almost finished most of them.
Whom will he send to finish you?
It seems he has few. In fact he has a
separate guy for his finance collection
His name is 'Collection' Shekar
He is the man around when it
comes to collect loaned finance
Also, he has hired 2 more men
1 guys looks like an IT professional
Quiet sharp fellow it seems
Very dedicated towards his work
Another guy is well built
but looks innocent
Quiet an impulsive guy
So, what is our plan?
We are sending vehicles
to pick all our guests
That's safe for us. We have
informed everyone about it
To board the car...
What's that?
Boss?
- A banner with you on it
- I know that!
But why is my face not seen?
Boss, aren't you absconding
according to police?
That is why we are not revealing you
Indeed!
Who came up with
this idea, dear?
It is my brainchild, boss
Awesome!
Why are you screaming like
I shot you in the chest?
Stop screaming! So you were saying...
The car...
Why are you stuttering?
Drink water and then tell me
Aren't you dead yet?
Go!
Make banners where my
face is clear and bold!
Or else you'll obituary
poster will be made!
Ok, boss
Quenched your thirst?
Now, tell me .To board the car?
The last four digits on every
guest's mobile is their code
'Court' Kumar's number is 9444131157
So his code is 1157
Only then our driver will pick him up
Who came up with this idea?
Him
What the heck!
They'll send a car for pick up
I said couple of my men
will attend on my behalf
I want you both to go
Welcome!
Are you sure you want these 2 to go?
- Wait and see what I do to you
- Mosquito!
Did you collect money from the
guy who owes us 5 million?
I'm going to his locality today evening.
I'll collect it
First, focus on your job and get it done
He has been missing for 2 days now
How about we lodge a police complaint
Get your bike. Let's go and check it out
I left it for service
Book an Ola cab
- That'd work
- He'll only book!
The pick up car will wait
by Selva Vinayagar temple
Listen to me!
Don't disconnect the call. We want
to hear what they are talking
"8116"
"8116"
Say this code, board the
vehicle and head to the party
- First time?
- Yes
I came to city to become a gangster
Our boss took me in and will make
me a gangster when right time comes
And now suddenly he handed this project
- Hope you won't screw up
- God no!
Tell me and I'll obey you
It's loading but no cabs booked yet
Don't worry I'll pay
Seriously it's not loading
- Dude! Dude!
- Wait, I'm checking
Hold on! Give me your phone
to recharge net pack
- Give me your phone
- Wait! Wait, I'll give
- I'll give, wait
- Take out the phone!
My PUBG team is getting busted!
- Please, quick! Give me the phone
- Wait, I'll give!
If it unties...
you will find yourself in danger!
We got the One Time
passcode for our cab!
Connected? Good, let's
continue the game
Thanks Gandhi
Hello
Cab driver here. I'm in a different car.
Not in the one that the app shows
I am waiting below the deity's
cutout near the temple
You'll come across many wrong people!
Your life will be in danger!
Until this vow is complete, you
must not tell about it to anyone!
Ravi will be there to help you
Get the work done properly!
Properly!
Got it?
I only understood this
We'll go, step out....
and finish him off!
- This car?
- Yes, this one
Boss, I saw them
But they have their reservation
about getting into the car
But the car number is different
The cab driver said that he's
coming in a different car
Boss, tell me how they look
A stout fellow...
but has a childish behaviour
The 2nd guy looks very sweet
But he's the real poison
that will kill us
But the number plate
is in white board
Correct but there is also a 3rd person
'Collection' Shekar!
Sakkara has sent 3 of his men
All of them are trapped
like chickens!
Sir, the OTP number please
Now what's an OTP?
What's that?
- Sir, the 4 number code sent to your mobile number
- That one!
"8116"
- All set. Come on
- Boss, it's them! Confirmed!
3 of them are there
Don't disconnect the call.
Just pick them and come
We shall finish them nice and slow!
- Correct? Get in!
- Yes
- Get in
- Ok
Stop playing with the phone and get in
Driver, turn on the AC
Sir...
where's the drop point?
Stop acting like you don't know
Just take us to that place. Go!
Fine, I'll follow the map in the app
We'll go, step out
and finish him off!
Why are you selfish?
Increase the volume
There!
Sir...
Sir...
Aren't you scared at all?
Or do you have other ideas?
We'll go, step out
and finish him off!
Step out...
As soon as we step out?
Top notch!
Listen, Ravi...
my men aren't dummies!
They are like two bullets
triggered from two snipers!
Their target is fixed!
They won't rest until job is done
They are coming down with a rage!
Listen, Sakkara...
I have an excellent plan
It'll be more easier
Does your plan end with Dilli's death?
I want Dilli dead. Does you
plan end with Dilli's death?
Listen to me Sakkara...
I want Dilli dead. Does you
plan end with Dilli's death?
Listen to me!
You baldie! Hang up now!
Doofus!
This is why I don't
attend his calls
Keeps advising all the time!
Dilli!
I'll bring the grandest and biggest garland
Get that garland shop's contact!
'Your time is up...'
Drive carefully or all our time will be up!
He'll finish 10 of them by himself!
Now, we 3 are coming. We'll
finish off the whole gang!
Boss!
- That too when you are here?
- Too much, right?
But sir, there will be
lot of them over there
Will you let me enjoy the music?
Nice song. Who is the music director?
Hope you guys are wearing
the bullet proof jacket
Bullet proof jacket?
Boss, until now we have
seen it only in the movies
Of late Dilli Babu is being too arrogant
Keeps running off and hides
This time when I catch hold of him...
Wait and watch!
First, let the 3 of us go in
Hope the sniper is ready
Get to the top of the building...
and when you have the aim,
shoot right on the forehead!
His head must splash!
Boss, why do you look worried?
If he has sniper, you have me!
I'll kill them all!
Look kiddo, make sure our
men are placed all over
With weapons!
Got it?
Ok, boss!
Sir Rs. 157
Just wait
Don't step out. The scene is
totally different outside
This song has made an impact inside me
Don't you step out! Things
are not looking good!
I am fearless! What? Things
are not looking good?
Increase the volume!
I am here to wreck havoc!
- Listen to me!
- Don't you order me!
Move!
Listen to me!
Move away!
What was the plan?
We'll get down and put him down!
Uh-oh!
Thought we'll put him
down not the weapons
- Fine
- Look straight!
Straight?
Oh Lord, please ensure
we reach home safe!
Hallelujah!
What's going on?
The trip has already ended in the app
Some problem with the app?
Gandhi, do one thing.
Pay and cut the driver off
Please! No! God!
- Why are you screaming? What's wrong?
- Please! No!
Come on, bro. Don't worry
You know our problem
hence you're saying "No"
But this is your job and
we must settle you!
Please, I have wife and kids
Which is why I'm telling that
it's our duty to cut you off here
Wait. Watch we me do it for you
You do one thing, wait
here for 5 minutes
We'll just check if Dilli
is here and return
- Ok. Sounds good
- I'll go check if Dilli is around
Looks like a party. Whoa!
Hope you won't tell anyone
Looking for Dilli Babu, right?
Wearing a blue color coat...
He is inside
- Go, meet him. Go!
- Coat?
That doofus wears a coat?
Uh-oh! Ouch!
Doesn't look like a place
Dilli would like to come
How is that you drink so
much when the booze is free?
4 out!
- Mani! Mani!
- Superb!
What are you doing here?
I came looking for Dilli
Why would Dilli come to such a place?
If he is depressed, then
chances are he might
Bloody Sakkara Das gang!
You are done for!
Boss, confirm
Sakkara Das' men
They are talking about
finishing off our boss
Look at them, boss.
Very dangerous fellows
They don't know where is our boss.
They are looking for him
See that gesture? They are
planning to butcher him down!
They are here with a rage!
What's your name?
Nelson, sir
- Your name?
- Manickam
Where are you coming from?
From Nelson Manickam road
Give me that
Sir!
- Hello
- Ravi!
Did Manickam reach?
- No, Manickam is not here
- He is not there?
3 new guys have come
They look weak!
Is it?
They came in the car sent for you
Your men, right?
No
I sent Manickam and the guy who joined
newly as supervisor in my company
- Let me talk to Manickam and get back to you
- Ok
Wonder where they slipped
Damn! Enough please
Uh-oh!
Manickam, where are you?
Well, at the Poonamallee po....
Po?
Po?
Complete your sentence!
Doofus! I said say it!
Is your mouth stuffed?
Enough! I'll complete your sentence!
Poonamallee Green Park, right?
Why are you not replying? Ravi
tells me you're not over there
Return only after finishing off Dilli Babu!
Boss, they are Sakkara Das' men
Shall we finish them off?
Never be in a hurry to finish off anyone
After all we are the seniors
First, let's rag them and have some fun...
and then we'll finish them off
What's up, bros?
Aren't you having anything today?
We are teetotalers
For how long will you keep drining tea?
Have some booze today!
Drink and have fun!
This is the last day of your lives
I mean drink and have fun like
it's the last day of you life
Happy Birthday, boss!
Same to you, boss!
Sir, if we knew it was
your birthday today...
I would have gifted you a garland!
I am too going to
gift you a boquet
- He is a bit of crack pot, isn't he?
- You can say so
Shut up!
Uncle...
That was a bit too much
Tell me, dear
Happy birthday, uncle
Uncle?
Noted! Noted!
But I won't get upset at all today
Ask me why
Because today is my birthday and I'm happy!
So have fun! High-five!
Uncle, me too
No!
Boss...
Lets do it!
Why are you in a hurry?
Sir!
Dude, no!
Thank you, sir
We still have a minute to go!
Why are you in a hurry?
So eager to have the cake? Even
I'm not as excited as you are
Sir!
His watch!
Why are you guys so eager? We'll do it!
It's gonna be awesome!
- Correct!
- Come on, dear
Thank you, sir
How does our points table look?
Today's my birthday why are
these guys names on it?
Chennai Gangsters Leagu
We are the senior players...
and like Dhoni we are the kings
in finishing things off in style
Read it, Winner Dilli Babu!
Sir! It's time! Cut the cake!
Give me that, I must
first cut him down...
Wondering why such a long
knife to slit your throat?
It's for the cake. That's
the trend these days!
Trend!
- Shall I cut it?
- Please!
First piece is for you
Me? Look at that dude,
first piece is for me
No song before cutting the cake?
Boss, he is an expert in singing
Do your HipHop style!
He will sing!
- He can rap in one breath!
- Is it?
Dear...
- Come here
- Yes, uncle?
Breathe and sing
After you finishi singing...
then we'll take a call on your breathing
He is so funny! Superb, sir!
"Knvies that stab in the name of money..."

- Hello, excuse me....
- Who are these new kids?
They are showing off too much
They are Sakkara Das' men
They are here to finish off our boss
Wait and watch...
our boss will massacre them tonight!
Thiyagu!
Let's leave at once
Let's leave
- Gandhi?
- We'll call him!
- Come on! Come on
- Fine, wait
I can't hear you
Did you get hold of Dilli or not?
If I catch hold of
Dillibabu, he will be dead!
Whom were you talking to?
To a friend
Never trust your friends
Because I too had a friend
His name is Sakkara Das
He wanted become powerful than me
Nothing wrong in it
No
But he wants to finish off the
person who taught him the trade
Now, that's wrong. Isn't it?
Definitely!
That too he sends his men to
finish me off on my birthday!
Birthday?
Oh my God!
I thought you are a good singer and a
dancer but you are also an excellent actor!
Guess why I wanted you to sing?
You don't know, right?
Tell me why people have a goat farm?
To decorate it and enjoy?
No!
Why do people have chicken farm?
To pamper them?
It is for meat!
Do you think this is a toy gun?
Why are you laughing?
Answer me! Why are you laughing?
Was this Sakkara Das' idea?
Did he ask you to embarrass
me in front of my people?
Tell me! The why are you laughing?
Shall I finish you off? Shall I?
Boss, he is mocking at us!
- Look at him!
- Just finish him off, boss!
No, I think Sakkara Das has
planned up something else
He has planned up some idea to
finish us all with his help
No!
No! He must cry!
He must cry and beg for life!
He must cry begging to me for life!
He must weep!
Tie him up on this lamp
post and rip him apart!
Now!
Look! He's laughing even
after he has been tied up!
I am scared! Please, boss!
It'd have been over
if he has kept quiet
Look at him laugh!
They will finish him
off nice and slow
Poor fellow
He is kind person
He tipped me 200 rupees
Poor fellow!
I have conveyed your problems
to Lord Veerabadhran!
He'll take care of you!
25 years ago Dayalan laughed
and embarrassed Dilli...
Dilli finished him at that very
moment and took over his place
25 years later...
this fellow laughs at Dilli
Look, he keeps laughing!
Arrogant fellow!
Doesn't stop laughing!
He's laughing at our boss!
He's laughing at our boss!
Lord Veerabhadra, save me!
Don't got out in rain,
you'll catch cold!
Must be an urgent ride
You....doofus!
Watering the plants? Fool, come on!
Coming
What's this?
- Look! Police!
- You better hand over the gun!
He doesn't know to shoot!
Come on! Don't run, officer!
That fear in your eyes, thats all I need
Don't I know that I won't get
bail if I shoot an officer?
Take it
Come, let's go
Come on, all of you
Sir...
- Dilli Babu got arrested
- What?
He has our hard disk
So this is the awesome
plan you always talk of?
No Sakkara, I have something even
more awesome matter in my hands
Really?
How did it happen?
Some new guy, gave him
a run for his money
He laughed at you once
and here we are, in cuffs
Look! He's still laughing at you, boss
Remember, he must die only at our hands!
By the way, what's his name?
They said his name is Manickam
They have thrashed you so bad...
even a cat would leap to save it's life
You have never even raised hands on anyone
Won't you ever get angry?
A tiny fellow!
He is all over the place!
Top notch!
What a daring boy!
He shook the whole world!
Welcome back after a short commercial break
For some people their own
words are their enemies
But in the case of our
special guest today...
his life is his enemy
Well, let's hear out more
interesting things...
No...
Let's hear about more stranger
things in Gandhi's life
So, let's get back to the show
Tell me! Who are you?
What business do you have in that place?
Sir, I work in an IT company
My childhood friend went missing
So we booked a cab to
go lodge a complaint
- Dad, dip it in the milk and feed me
- Ok, dear
Sir...
we got into the wrong car
and ended up in that place
Sir, the main guy over there;
his name is also Dilli Babu
Sir...
my missing friend's name is also Dilli Babu
Yes, sir. Hence the confusion
Someone else took the cab that
we were suppose to ride in
Must slap myself with a crappy footwear
for believing he's a gangster!
Here, take it
Don't panic, drink it!
Careful. Don't choke yourself
Don't disturb the hair gel
Do you need all this in this age?
You often say that you feel giddy
You have so many medical issues
and you want to be a gangster?
Shall I tell you something?
I wasn't a thug earlier
You are not a thug even now
I have been growing
long hair for 3 years
- Isn't it part of a thug life?
- No
Fine, forget it
Myself and boss Sakkara
hail from the same native
I was running a Parotta outlet in
Pookuvaampatti near Coimbatore
Kuvaa?
Don't spoil my village's
name by pronouncing it wrong
Even if 100 people come
from Pookuvaampatti...
I will single handedly wield it
Wield what?
Of course the Parotta bread
Boss Sakkara loaned me money seeing
my style of preparing the batter
It is to repay that loan along
with interest, I joined under him
Have you pledged your
hotel or house to him?
If I had that much why would
I loan amount from him
Does he have any empty bond
paper with your sign on it?
Do I look like a fool to you?
Don't I know that one must not
sign in an empty bond paper?
You are indeed a fool!
Then why are you working under him.
Can't you go settle down?
Look here Nelson!
The whole world knows that Pookuvaampatti
people live by their words!
Your village won't even be
visible in the world map!
Stop barking like a mad dog!
- Am I the one barking?
- Of course it's you!
Look at him! Come here
Hear me out carefully
If Dilli Babu gang catches
us, we will be dead meat!
We didn't complete the
job Sakkara assigned us
Sakkara?
Did you just disrespect Sakkara?
Shut up! I am telling you that
Sakkara will finish us both!
Dude...
The call saved you
It's our boss. Wait, I'll tell him!
Look here...
'Collection' Shekar is going to
collect 5 million from a party
If we follow him and rob
him of that 5 million...
even if we die there will be a
meaning for all the risk that we took
5 million! Two shares, one
for you and one share for me
Correct!
With that I can clear my debts, right?
Crazy fellow!
I won't repeat, I'll slap you
5 million. Take your share
and go settle down somewhere
Brother...
Come, let's make a plan to rob Shekar
Shekar...
is all the welcoming party
ready for darling Gandhi?
All set as per your orders, boss
Superb!
Why such a big build up for this fellow?
Fool!
Will you laugh if Dilli Babu
points a gun on your head?
God!
Will you laugh if Dilli Babu
points a gun on your head?
Boss...
Will you laugh if Dilli Babu
points a gun on your head?
That's really difficult, boss
You know, right?
You know it's difficult, right?
This fellow has looked in to
the gun and laughed heartily
Garland is too less. Even erecting his
statue will fall short of praises
I wouldn't have been this
happier if Dilli Babu had died
Dilli Babu was insulted!
I shall pour moire oil into that
insult, set a wick and light it up!
Hit it!
What a grace you got when you laugh!
You laughter is going to take you places!
- Tell me
- Boss...
I beat Ravi to pulp and got the truth out
He has handed over the
hard disk to Sakkara Das
Sakkara Das is making a deal with the
minister to finish you off inside the prison
- Did you inquire properly?
- Yes, boss!
Those 3 guy who came that day,
all that was a total confusion
The 2 men whom Sakkara Das
sent the other day...
Finish them off!
Boss, that hard disk?
Hard disk, my foot! Forget about it
Nab that guy who kept laughing at me!
I want to finish him off
with my hands! Got it?
Ok, boss!
Mr. Minister! Stop beating around the bush!
Told you! Finish off Dilli Babu first...
then I shall hand over
you the hard disk. Ok?
(The subscriber you have called
in speaking to someone else)
Sakkara, Dilli Babu is calling me...
Dilli Babu?
Minister, I can't trust you.
After you are a pollutician...
Attend his call and put me in a
conference call. I shall quietly listen
- Tell me, Dilli
- What's up? Where are you?
At home
What's up, Sakkara? How have you been?
If you want to eavesdrop
in a conference call...
the first thing you must do
is put your phone in mute!
Mr. Thangadurai, did he lick you feet?
- Or did you...
- Shut up! Don't you go over board!
Do you think our politics
run on your behest?
Remember this Dilli...
You are just a number for me
I have 10 Dillis like you under me
Minister! Sorry for the interruption
Why do you need 10 Dilli?
Isn't 1 Sakkara enough?
Sakkara will be only worth
serving you tea and coffee
You can't finish off your
enemies, Thangadurai!
Doofus! Did someone train in you
in prison on stand up comedy?
There! You got it right!
Is that how you ended up making
that little kiddo laugh at you?
I can see you confidence raise
as I am inside the prison!
I am not talking too much
in fact it's very less
Let me tell you what the
word is talking about
"Look at Dilli Babu and laugh non stop!"
Now in a kid's voice
"Look at Dilli Babu and laugh non stop!"
How dare you? I'll finish you both
off the moment I step out of prison!
Shut up you fool! Hang up now!
Stop boring us!
Shameless mongrel!
I'll take care of you soon!
Wait and watch!
You mongrels! Why are you laughing?
That too looking over here!
Boss, we were laughing
over something else
In that case, look away and laugh!
- Ok, boss!
- Or else I'll finish you off!
First, ensure Dilli Babu is finished off!
Once we get the hard disk...
- then order Sakkara also to be finished off!
- Ok, sir
Give me this hard disk
once Dilli Babu is dead
- Then we'll hand it over to the minister
- Ok, boss
Dear...
Darling
My baby
Apple of my eye
I will say something...
You must not think I'm advising you
- That means it's an advice. Tell me
- Dear...
have you ever been in a plane?
No, dad
In a flight journey...
every passenger has an
individual oxygen mask assigned
So that in case of any emergency...
"First help yourself with the oxygen mask"
"Then help your co-passengers"
That's how they announce it
Same goes for our lives
First, if you take care of yourself...
the you may take good care
of everyone around you
Dad...
have you ever been in a plane?
No dear
Stop playing with the phone all the time!
- Save my son, Lord Veerabhadra!
- Stop scolding him all the time
Darling, it's ok. You don't mind her
Can't you even apply
the ash properly?
You applied it like applying
calcium sulphate on a wall!
What if it hurts his eyes?
Gandhi, we have an
important meeting tomorrow
Be there
Patel sir himself has sent me a message!
Sir, usually don't we send
an email for such things?
- Will you tell or should I do it?
- Sir, it'll be insulting
- Really?
- Yes, sir
Then I shall do it
Listen up, guys...
We are going to fire a few employees today
Remember, I told you! It's you!
Why are you laughing like you
are going to receive sweet?
Gandhi, can you step forward?
Does he think this a
bride choosing ceremony?
Our company has had the history of
excellence for the past 25 years
There are 10 engineers in every
street, who are unemployed
No matter what, don't laugh Gandhi!
I don't need employees who punch 'In time'
and while away time waiting for 'Lunch time'
Uh-oh! I must some how control myself!
Only a good employee can be a
good resource for the company
- Everyone's eyes are on me!
- Look at all the resumes here
It is all a big fat lie!
Is there a single fact in it?
- Come on, tell me
- If there was a fact, why would we work under you?
We have a book of rules
If even he basic criteria is not met...
then we don't need such
employees for the company!
What the hell is he doing?
Sir, book of rules
You only told, sir. Hence proved!
Shut up!
Gandhi!
You are fired!
He just fired me!
Are you joking?
Why are you laughing?
So I'm fired for real, sir?
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Why should I be, sir?
- Sir, it's so embarrassing!
- Manoj, ask him to get out!
Sir, let me tell you something...
I am so saddened by the fact
that I must leave you all
Get lost!
Get out!
Bye!
Sir!
Our company's award fell down!
I am sorry!
Bye!
You! I can understand others laughing.
Why are you laughing?
Sir, when you said our company
is a reputed company...
he stuffed his mouth!
So that he can prevent
himself from laughing
Everyone, get back to work!
Sorry, sir. Sorry
Sir, please don't mistake
Dude, that was some awesome mocking!
Hop on
- Gandhi
- Dad?
Why are you upset?
- I got fired, dad
- You got fired?
Thought I'll be shocked like that?
It's after all a job
You don't lose your life!
So what if you lost an IT job. Run
a tea stall in the IT corridor
A tea shop owner earns more
than all of you in IT company
Got it?
Take daddy for example
I was a bus driver
Suddenly I lost my job
Didn't I become an ambulance driver?
What job do we do doesn't matter, Gandhi
What matters is that job we do must
make us happy and keep us at peace
Stop crying
Well not just that, dad.
Ankita is pretty upset with me
I though I shall convince her somehow
But now that I lost my job...
That's it! Already her dad
is against our relationship
My love life is over, dad
Dad, middle class boys like me...
can't afford to fall in love, right?
Looks like he is too serious about her
Is that all?
Come
What is it, dad?
Dad!
Why did you bring me to Anki's home?
Call her out
Call her
I said, call her
Anki...
Anki...
And then what?
Stop being a wuss!
- Anki!
- Dad! Dad!
Ankita!
Dad, please no!
Ankita!
Who is that at this hour?
Greetings, sir
Why are you here?
Sir...
Let's put aside the past.
Please don't mistake us
It's my fault, forgive me
My son is suffering a lot
without your daughter's love
Youths, they fell in love with each other
It's us the elders who
must give up our ego
Your son isn't suitable for my daughter.
We have fixed another alliance, Leave!
Sir! Sir!
Please, sir. It's their life
Please have some consideration
- Please dad. Spare a thought for us
- Shut up!
I made this decision after a
giving it a good thought!
If I marry off my daughter to
your son, imagine her life!
She will be fine. I swear,
she'll have a great life!
My son is first person stand
up for people's problems
So imagine how he much he'll
take care of his wife!
He'll take care? How? With what?
Minimum 3 bhk?
Does he own a car?
At least a salary of Rs. 100,000?
And you say he'll take care of her?
Your hurting them pa!
So you won't marry you daughter to a
middle class boy without all these?
Yes, I won't. Get out!
Confirm?
Confirm it seems
Excuse me!
Listen to me you
'Donald Duck' face!
How much more should I play humble?
What did you ask?
3 bhk, 1 car...
and a salary of Rs. 100,000?
How about a wedding in
the middle of an ocean?
How about the groom arrives in
a helicopter for the wedding
A new dress everyday. 365 dress a year
Keep demanding!
If the same thing the groom's family demands?
You'll call it dowry and press charges!
What do you call these
demands that you are making?
Gandhi, wipe it!
Dad, already spat and did it
Get that!
Fine, forget all this. What did
you have when you got married?
Tell me
Tell me!
Right! Like he had a lot!
It was all dowry from my parents
Shut up!
Dear Ankita, you're helpless
You must obey your father
You guys easily call off a relationship
Boys don't vent out their feelings
The keep all the feelings within and...
Look he's crying. Don't cry, dear
Please dear, don't cry
Don't laugh and play spoilsport!
My baby
Everyone's making my son suffer a lot
Sir!
- Don't see what are the boy's possession
- Whoa! Here comes the punch dialogue!
See to that the boy is genuine and kind
- Stop it!
- Dad!
Who's that?
- Dear! What's going on?
- Gandhi!
Stop it!
Excuse me!
We promised we'll repay the money! Then
why are they breaking stuffs. Stop it!
Just a minute
Stay quiet and only house
hold stuffs will break
- Or else you're head will also break!
- Sir, please!
- Sir!
- Anki! No!
Sir!
Do you know him?
How are you related to him?
His son-in-law
Dad, quiet!
Really?
Say yes!
Stop thinking!
Just stop thinking and say yes!
Yes
Oh! Come on, sir. You should have
told us that he is your son-in-law
Guys, stop it! Stop!
Stop it!
Tell me, Shekar
Boss, I came to collect the money
The concerned party is
Gandhi's father-in-law
Gandhi's father-in-law?
- Put the call on speaker mode
- Sure, boss
Sir, greetings
If you had given me a hint that
you are Gandhi's father-in-law...
I wouldn't have sent
my men to you home!
He is great guy!
Widen you chest. More!
- But why dad?
- Or else they'll finish all of us!
Having the documents of such a guy's
father-in-law with me is insulting for my image
I shall courier your documents tomorrow
Just sign it, ok?
Sir...
I couldn't repay because
the interest was too much
Along with the principle
we'll return the 2 million
We don't need your money, sir
Come on, sir
Ok, as you wish
Sir, put Shekar on the line
Ok, boss
I shall say that
Sir, return the money when you can
Sir! Sir!
I shall repay it tomorrow
Sir, come on. Don't be so innocent
Gandhi!
Put your arms around her shoulder
- Why?
- Just do it!
- No need, dad
- He'll marry her off to someone else
Ankita...
It's ok. Let it be
Sir...
your scooter is damaged
I shall repair it
Dear, you drop them home
On the way back, have dinner at...
- what's that multicuisine restaurant at Adyar?
- Sir...
Sir, what you spend on 3 people at a 5 star
hotel is a feast for 30 people in our hood
She's coming as my daughter-in-law to our
locality for the first time. Come on, sir!
"Rice cake with fish gravy
is the best combo as you and me!"
"You are important to me
like how a salad is nothing without the broccoli"
"There are many such flavors of love,
shall I show them all to you?"
"How about I feed some love too?"
"Instead of sitting inside
and just being formal"
"Step down and check out
the local flavours"
"Our leader, Gandhi's smile can
be found in the currency note"
"Our boy Gandhi's smile can be
found in your heart's beat"
"Our leader, Gandhi's smile can
be found in the currency note"
"Our boy Gandhi's smile can be
found in your heart's beat"
"Welcome to my hood and meet
my people, who raised me"
"Here they are, to meet the
girl who swept me of my feet"
"Please meet the juniors of my hood"
"They too are here to meet
the one who stole my heart"
"My good time that I found my love"
"I am so excited that I
am singing and dancing"
"A flying kiss from her drove me crazy"
"Millions of soap bubbles and nostalgia"
"The nostalgia in it is my
baby's face that I see in it"
"Come, let me take you
on this colorful ride"
"We shall dine and have dessert at
the famous outlets by the seashore"
"He is the king of laughter and
she is the queen of beauty"
"Love has sparked between them
and nothing can separate them"
"You are mine forever"
"Our leader, Gandhi's smile can
be found in the currency note"
"Our boy Gandhi's smile can be
found in your heart's beat"
"Our leader, Gandhi's smile can
be found in the currency note"
"Our boy Gandhi's smile can be
found in your heart's beat"
Dude, our friend Dillibabu has
posted a suicide note status
Yes!
My friend Dillibabu has posted
that he is going to commit suicide
Mani, Dillibabu wants to
commit suicide it seems
- Let's get him before he does something crazy
- Come on!
Anki, careful with the money
I'll send you the location. Be there
I am on my way
Inform that finance person too
Ok. Mom, I'm stepping out. Bye
Don't say 'Bye'. Say 'See you'
How many times should I tell him!
Lord, save us all
Famous gangster Dilli Babu who
was arrested an Panmai...
attacked the police and
broke out from prison
The police has set up a
force to hunt him down
I'm standing right opposite to the
shop you told me. Make it fast
- Shekar
- Where?
Indeed him!
- Let's go inside
- Screw up and I'll finish you off!
Lets go in first
These guys look familiar
It's indeed them!
Perumal boss, it's me Papa
Remember the photo you
sent me other day?
I just saw those guys entering
a gift shop in Anna Nagar
Who?
Those guys who laughed at our boss?
Not them, the photo of Sakkara's men
and were meant to come that day
Those guys!
Sakkara Das' men
- Keep an eye on them, I'll be there
- On it, boss
You, one more tea!
Let me see how they can
escape my eagle eyes!
Nelson...
it's so nice. Buy me one
- Fool! Stop acting like a kid
- Forget it!
Sorry, it was an accident
I am very sorry
What are they doing for so long inside?
He owes us Rs. 3000
He'll wait meanwhile he'll
get the cash from the ATM
I'll be back after lunch.
You take care of the shop
Please do come back.
Please have trust on us!
What's the ATM pin? 3550?
It's 5035
- 5035! 5035!
- You!
Are you nuts?
Don't we have a gun?
Indeed, will it compensate for Rs. 3000?
Don't make me raise hands on you!
Use this to threaten! Got it?
Go!
- This shop, right?
- Yes
Do you have egg fritters?
You want me to pay up Rs. 3000?
Excuse me
Do you know anyone called Priya?
Anyone called Priya working here?
Are you all Dillibabu's friends?
Yes. We have been looking
for him for the past 3 days
Did I just hear the name Dilli Babu?
Give it to me, sir
Shymala...
how much for the metallic gun?
It's Rs. 300
Priya works here
She said things didn't
work out with Dillibabu
I asked her why...
and she said 'No means no!'
She said he didn't earn enough
She spoke as if she didn't knew
all these facts about him earlier
It was me who gave him
Priya's wedding invitation
- Priya is getting married?
- Why are these guys looking for Dilli Babu?
Where is wedding? Any idea?
Somewhere in Ulundurpettai
I think it's KRK Mahal
Assumptions won't work out
Give us the detailed address
Wait, first let me
attend to the customer
Excuse me...
That was embarrassing!
Shut up!
Why did that girl become upset?
- Anki...
- That's it he won't mind us now
- Hi
- Hi
That guy is waiting right opposite to this
shop. Shall we go and hand him the money?
Not good to deal money in the open road.
Call and ask him to come here
These guys look quite familiar
Where have I seen them?
Sir, birthday?
Birthday! Correct!
Ok, sir
Sir, Rs. 300
Rs. 300?
Yes, sir
Your owner said Rs. 3000
Did my hairstyle intimidate him?
Cool
Thank you
No thanks!
- Let's head to KRK hall at Ulundurpettai!
- We must! We will!
- And we'll nab Dillibabu!
- Yes! We will!
Nab Dilli Babu?
- He is driving us furious!
- Driving them furious?
Nelson!
Like us, another group
is chasing Dilli Babu
Who are they?
- Remember that birthday party..
- Shekar! Shekar!
The principle on Rs. 2 million is there.
Please check it
Ok
Ok, boss. See you
Ready for the hunt?
Meet me, I'm Dora! Where are we headed now?
Tell me, where?
- To loot the money!
- Super!
Shall we?
Why are you looking into
the bag, you doofus! Look away!
Let me puncture his bike tyres
Puncture!
- Give me the bag!
- Please give us the bag!
Poor fellow, don't beat him too much.
He might faint
- Come on!
- The money is now ours
Stop! Stop!
They just escaped from my eagle eyes!
- Here
- Thank you
Quick, pick up the call!
Hello?
Boss!
They ran away! Quick, come to the main road
Looks like they escaped.
They aren't in there
Look! It's Perumal!
- Uh-oh!
- Uh-oh! It's indeed Perumal!
Run! Run!
Oh God!
Whoa! Police! Disperse! Run!
We slipped again! What
will I tell our boss now?
What happened?
- Check if they left
- He's checking
- No one's here. They left!
- No one's here?
No one's around it seems
- Come, let's escape!
- Come on! Come on!
- Dad's ambulance sound!
- Thank God!
They ran away buddy.
Didn't I tell you?
Come on bro
It sounds like
father's ambulance
Excuse me!
Did you see that?
Wow, uncle how come you
came by the right time?
25 years of experience as
an ambulance driver...
and as his father too
Look at him. My
son is all smiles
Come on. Get into the car
Get in. Get into the car
Close the door Gandhi
Gandhi close the door.
Close the door
Close
And off we go! There
BOSS, they escaped
I took care of the
vehicle's number
- TN 0
- Stop it
You tell me
KRK Mahal, Ulundurpettai
Start the car
Anbu!
Come to KRK Mahal, Ulundurpettai
along with our brother
Gandhi is headed there too.
Let's finish him off
Oh my God
- Nelson, they are new bank notes
- Keep it inside
- Why are you so scared?
- Keep your mouth shut, monkey
What is this?
A Powerbank. He will be scared
if I show anything to him
We will keep it
My body is tired after all the fights
- Shall we stop for a juice?
- What ?
Let's have Fig juice.
It will be good
Let's drink
Why is the whole town so quiet?
Don't pop your head out?
Headquarters? Head
straight and take a left
Hey, fool. Beware not
to lose your head
- No need to say thanks buddy
- Thyagu!
- Why isn't he answering?
- Thyagu
Thyagu, buddy
Can't you hear Mani
bro calling you?
They called me to ask for directions.
I helped them
Why is the town so quiet?
There is no reaction
Thyagu
Buddy, you are bleeding
Blood?
Daddy, thyagu is
bleeding from his ears
Why do you laugh while I bleed?
You were bleeding, that's why I laughed
We will wipe of the blood. Dillibabu
has updated another status
Love reminds you of Rose flower
She...
She was so beautiful
from the inside...
I kept her in my heart
like a rose flower
But...
while leaving...
while leaving it was like
uprooting the entire plant...
the thorns were all over my body,
wounding me, covering my body with blood
With that pain...
I am leaving too...
Daddy, take us to the
marriage hall now
Ask him to be quiet.
Look at my driving now
See how difficult it is to
earn 5 million rupees
It is too risky to be here.
Let's leave soon
Is it?
There isn't enough sugar in here.
Bro, add some sugar in this
Hey, it's Sakkarai
Wait, let me get it first
Two spoons are enough.
We are going to get it
The master idiot is here.
Let's manage
Hey!
What are you doing here?
We were searching you
all over the place
Brother
It's nothing brother
He is crying because he
couldn't finish off Dilli babu
How come you are holding
Collection Shekar's bike?
There were two of them...
escaping fast...
When inquired we found that the
bag belongs to our company
Then we assaulted them...
to recover the bag
We were about to call you
to return this bag to you
Now I am here. Give me that
What did I ask you to do?
Can't you even attend your phone?
I will see to you guys. Follow me now
- Come over
- Come
Nelson, what about the bike?
Don't feel sympathetic over
the bike that is not yours
Head to the warehouse
Shekar
You useless fool!
Had these not for these two men, the
money you lost couldn't have been saved
The irony is your name
is collection Shekar
I learnt now that you
are the snappy Shekar
Bro, I kept it inside
this bag only.
The hard disk is missing
What do you mean?
- Senior please search properly
- I remember keeping it here,brother
Is it? It's alright. Please
search one more time
- Bro, its missing
- Oh my God. What will I do now?
I scolded the minister based on this hard
disk. He won't spare me if gets to know
Any idea?
Did you guys see the hard disk?
The person who took the bag must
have taken the hard disk, sir
That's right
This seems to be
perfectly planned ordeal
They were wearing Chotta
Bheem and Dora masks
Where in the city will
I find a Chotta Bheem
Boss...
We would find Chotta Bheem in
Dolakhpur said the actress
It must Dilli Babu's men
who planned the robbery
Where will the republic
nation could ask for?
Dilli babu is headed towards
Ulundurpettai KRK Marriage hall
- How do you know?
- That was!!!
Why do you cough together?
Minister has started calling me
How do I talk to him? He talks a lot.
Yes, minister
Did you kill Dilli Babu?
Did you check the news?
Dilli has escaped from Jail. He
must be on his way to kill us!
I will track him
down and kill him
Keep the hard disk safe
Is it safe?
Sakkara
If something is to
happen to the hard disk
I will kill you too
Why have you gone all silent?
Be quiet
Do you know where is Dilli Babu?
KRK mahal, Ulundur pettai
How is my update?
I ask you to move to
KRK Mahal immediately
Kill Dilli Babu and his remains must
be displayed for public viewing
Do the job I asked you to? I
will take care of my work
Ok
Oh my God!
He is the ruling party. He
will anything he wishes to do
You are cursed, bloody fool
They will play with the butt plugs
Pull over daddy. This is the place.
Do not drive into the kitchen
Get down. Get down dear
- Get down
- Make way buddy
Come on buddy
Do stay for the feast
- Manoj
- Manoj, how come you are here
Welcome Gandhi
Although I didn't invite you
You made it to the right place
Came to the right place?
This is my sister's wedding
Look at my sister. She
is an epitome of beauty
Isn't she an angel?
Did he just swear his sister?
He called her an angel.
Now come along
That's my dear sister
She is an angel from heaven
An unboxed fresh
doughnut in the oven
She is the apple of our eyes
The dream girl of all the guys
- Gandhi, recognize her?
- Oh my God
Dillibabu has
fallen for this girl
Dillibabu, were you planning
to take your life for her?
Pity on him
Come along buddy. Don't feel shy
Come
Gandhi
The groom ...

you a job. You are my friend after all
Mr.Groom... Mr.Groom

Buddy...
Buddy...
Do you know the groom already?
- Bro, he is my backlogs friend....

Buddy!
For the first time something
good is happening in my life
A dream girl like her...
She is a dream girl to me...
Buddy
Don't you spoil anything
with this mouth of yours
Do enjoy the feast
Lover no 2, the guy who spoiled
our plan in coffee shop...
has come here too
Where is the thing I asked for?
- I have it here
- Take it
Here
If we make her drink this...
within 7 seconds...
her bones will freeze
within the next 18 seconds...
her pulse will plummet
In 20 seconds...
all her senses will shut down...
and she will freeze all over
I will then walk up to her...
and shout 'Oh my God, My stomach aches'
I will tease her to my heart's content
Dillibabu has updated
another status
What's with him
Won't you attend my call?
He asks her to attend the call.
She keeps staring at her phone
It must be Dillibabu who is calling her
You snatch her phone somehow
You want me to steal?
Yeah. Please go and
take her phone
The crowd looks happy. I guess
Dilli babu hasn't died yet
Boss
Dilli is still alive
The hard disk is still inside, isn't it?
When Dilli sees me...
won't he be shocked?
Of course bro. 200 % sure
That's my boy
See how confident he is
We kill him first...
and we take the hard disk then
Hey!
How could you see when
your hair is like this?
Paste your hair this way
- Come now
- I am coming idiot
I am in the CCTV room alright
I am watching them
Search carefully
Ok
What is that sound?
He keeps doing this
I lost my ears now
If I catch him once,
I will kill...
Who is this mallu uncle?
Aren't you Gandhi?
Yes, sir
Aren't you searching
for Dilli babu?
- Yes, sir
- I thought so
Do you know me?
Das
Sakkara Das
Forget it
I wanted to ask you something
How did you manage to
laugh at Dilli babu?
I was waiting to properly
thank you since then
- I need to gift you something
- No thank you, sir
Wait there
Drink up this juice first, we
will take care of the rest then
Sir... sir...
There is no sugar in it
- I have diabetes
- A lizard fell in it
You know this is wasted
Why the hell do you
serve this then?
Thank you, sir
Thank you so much
Why does he laugh after
somebody hit him?
Nervous laughter...
May be he is like me...
- Brother!
- Mr.Sweet smile
Now what you got to do is...
Keep up your spirit and walk ahead...
pull out your knife...
and point it at Dilli babu...
I know this knife is nothing
before your smile...
Your smile is
equivalent of 10 knives
We are going to make this the
last night of Dilli babu
What a perverted being?
Why should we meet up
at his wedding night?
Babu, how am I going to
find you with these idiots?
That's the smile... that's the spirit
Keep up the smile. Dilli babu,
you are done with today
Why am I surrounded by idiots?
- Why do you worry? Let me take care of the
phone - It's alright sister, thank you
You look really busy,
hand me the phone
No, I am waiting for
an important call
- I will take care of this. Thank you
- Ok
Isolate that laughing mongrel first
Serving juice in a feast seems
to be brilliant idea now
Bro, hand me the juice
This is not for you
Wasn't it right here?
Where has it gone now?
Boss!
Drink this up
You look tired
- Drink up
- We couldn't find it
I will find it out for you
Where will I search now?
Dilli babu, Ulundurpettai is going
to be your final resting place
Dear, what is this?
Who are they?
They are my friends
- Friends?
- Yes
- Don't you have any girl friends?
- No
Careful guys
Sister, could you hold this for a second?
See how big the gift is?
- Let's take a selfie bro
- Hey, keep your hands off her
Sister! Sister, my phone!
Sister, give my phone back
It's Ok. I will take care
Hey, show me your face
Pose for the photo
In 18 seconds, his pulse will plummet
Look, there he is
Did you see Dillibabu?
Dillibabu peed... on whom?
Come here
Gandhi!
It's Dillibabu
Hey, this is your end my son
Laugh now
He is laughing!
His senses will shut down
and he will freeze over
When you couldn't taste the
ice cream that is nearby
I couldn't kill even
with him by my side
What has happened to my body? Move
Gandhi... Run
Hey! What is happening?
Sir, look at that
Oh my God
Where are you off to? Sit down, sir
It is too violent outside.
It is safe to stay here
Hey! I own this place
My bladder is full, I
couldn't leak one drop
What is this new form of disease?
Where is he off to?
Nelson
He poses like a model in a beach
Bro, even in death you got a smile. The
wedding has now turned into a funeral now
- He has got pulse
- Pulse?
Lift him up!
Lift him. Lift him
Snatch that 5 million
Make him frown. Kill the smile
My smile kills too, you idiots
Let's go now
He escapes somehow!
So it's a one on one then
I can't even finish one buddy
Here I come for you buddy
Won't you ever learn your lesson?
Enter the dragon
It looks like a train journey
- It was you who started it all
- I started it?
- Yes - Why did you cheat
Dillibabu in the name of love?
- Dillibabu?
- Don't you know?
He is not my lover
He is my boy bestie
Who are these boy besties?
Dillibabu has posted a Tik
Tok video in the group
Who is that bugger?
Hello buddies!
Hello from the marriage hall!
Rohith...
I am Dillibabu
How long have you known her?
6 months?
I have known her for years
- To hell with this marriage - Trust
me I have changed. You are my last...
You could marry her now
But she will elope with me someday
Because the love
that we had is ...
TRUE
True... Funny face
Pig faced boy bestie...
I am going to tear you apart
Give me that
We got 2 million now, it's alright
We will divide the share
once we are outside
- What happened?
- Stay quiet
Oh my!
No power in my phone
Use this to charge your phone
Plug it in
What is this?
Power bank
This is the hard disk
Everyone are searching this, you idiot
How can a power bank
be used as hard disk?
Dillibabu!
Dillibabu!
Open the door! It's me Gandhi!
Dillibabu!
Dillibabu!
What happened?
Let me tell you why
I'll only tell you this
Because every time I tell
my sorrows to others...
they laugh
But if I tell you...
you consider it as your own
sorrow and feel bad about it
It's been an hour since I died
He's dead?
Fool!
Watch your step!
I'm talking to him
The moment she didn't pick my calls,
even after calling her 47 times...
is the moment I died, buddy
What is it?
Well buddy, you're right
But she didn't bother to pick your call
She has moved on
Then why are you calling her?
Don't call her
Just 3 more miss calls
Shall I round it off to 50 calls?
Buddy...
This love has only
given you troubles
Forget it
Just forget it right here, right now
Well, nothing wrong in telling you
When you guys called me
I put your calls on wait...
because I'd be talking to her
But now when I call her...
her phone is always engaged
Buddy!
She moved on easily and is
all set for another future
Right here, downstairs her
reception is happening
If she can move on then
can't you move on too?
People change
What was that?
People change
Memories don't
Google!
What makes me realize that I'm alive is...
is the pain that I am going through
He's laughing!
Told you, didn't I?
I'm crying! I swear, I'm crying!
Come on, guys!
Why are you picking your nose?
I thought I shouldn't tell you this
Do you know what she told her friend
at the shop she used to work?
What?
You aren't earning as much
as she expected you to earn
And it seems you aren't worth
her or her expectations
Which is why she agreed to this marriage
Go inquire around and you'll
find out about her games!
Beyond all this...
I feel so bad to see you
feel so bad for losing her
You guys have a wrong notion about her
If she is talking about my earnings then...
it is her concern for me, so
that I'll be driven to earn more
As far as this groom is concerned...
she's just a girl working
in the gift shop
But as far as I'm concerned...
she is herself a gift!
How can you all judge her?
You tell me buddy...
does she looks like someone
who is behind money?
Tell me
Tell me, buddy!
Uh-oh!
What?
I said, tell me
I cannot control it anymore!
Why are you laughing?
No, I am crying!
Does my love life appear to you as a joke?
Buddy!
Shall we prove it by living a
successful life for you all to see?
Wanna bet? Shall me
and my girl prove it?
Are you laughing and
trying to provoke me?
I'll slit my wrist!
Now, do you believe that my
love is sincere and true!
He slit his wrist for real!
Hey! Dude! Buddy! He's still alive
Look, he's still laughing
- Are you crazy?
- Dude, get up!
Why did you do this?
True love never fails
Why didn't you slit your throat instead?
Look, he's still laughing!
He slit himself and you wanna laugh?
Die you stonehearted idiot!
Kick him!
Why is he laughing instead of crying?
At least we laughed in a quiet manner! You
laugh so hard that too sitting next to him
I swear I am not laughing!
But that last thing he said...
asking if she is someone
behind money...
Ok, I'll go check on him.
You wait here
Did you ever meet that
gangster Dilli Babu again?
No. Never
Hi Dilli sir
So you laugh when something
bad happens to you?
Holy guacamole!
Without realizing that I
was running behind you!
That's ok
We are all running without realizing
what is that we are running for
Don't you worry about this condition
It's actually a good one!
Others cry in sorrow but you're laughing.
Be happy about it!
I understood one thing really
well in those 6 months
I am not some
supernatural person...
There are many out there like me
Hiding millions of worried inside...
but when someone asks them 'How are you?"
They'd smile and say "I am fine!"
They'll say so
Most of them whom we think
are very happy in life...
but they have thousands
of issues in their life
Like I realized this fact, if
you all could realize it...
then you will try your
best not to hurt anyone
Then you laughing habit...
How did it get cured?
I went and met my friend again
This without being myself...
I just acted as if I'm concerned
That's what, the fruits and energy drink
powder. Isn't that the whole world believes in?
I'm sure he'd have
laughed inside!
What we feel inside...
that's not important
The world judges us based on
how we show out our emotions
Well, then...
I started acting in front of everyone
Dad, let's leave
Just one final question
Can you tell us what issues
of late have made you laugh
When the whole nation were worried that our
satellite Chandrayan didn't land in moon...
Our locality boys alone...
Were also worried about 3rd block Chandru
Worried that he slipped and
fell into the drainage
That made me laugh!
When our beloved Abdul Kalam sir died...
half of the students who status saying
that we'll make sure his dreams come true....
but today those students are
fighting over their favorite stars
They indulge in violence and
even set each other ablaze!
All this makes me laugh!
Back then we bowed in
front of our rulers...
today we are doing the same at work
Half life is over at work place
The rest is over by the time we reach home
Think about such a life...
and that makes me laugh!
17 guys!
They abducted a minor, raped her
for months and finished her off!
We destroy the forest...
yet we live in a concrete
jungle like beasts
That makes me laugh!
Being a bystander and witnessing all
such issues happening right in front...
and by passing comments on it...
by having no compassion or concern...
and getting on with my life
because I have my own works...
and when I think that it just
makes me a normal human being
My inefficiency...
that makes me laugh!
