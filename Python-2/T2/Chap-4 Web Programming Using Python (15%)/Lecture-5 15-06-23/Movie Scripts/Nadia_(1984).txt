Good morning, Professor!
My name is Bela Karolyi. I'm a
specialist in Physical Education.
Oh, yes?
I'm recruiting little girls
for new gymnastics school
and I noticed that you had...
Just girls.
Yes.
I see.
Well, they develop
faster than boys.
We believe that we can
train them in a normal...
I'm very busy now.






Excuse me.
Yes, but I...
Contact the central office.
That wastes a lot of time.
I have so many schools to visit.
Excuse me.
Good morning, students!
Good morning, comrade Professor.
Which of you were doing
cartwheels outside?
There were two.
How about you?
Were you one?
Professor, we have work to do.
One moment, please.
I am going to the Director.






All right, attention, girls!
Who would like
to learn gymnastics?
Raise your hands?
You know,
tumbling,
and cartwheels.
Who likes to do cartwheels?
You, and you.
You take these home
to your parents.
Weren't you one
of the cartwheelers?
I wonder, wonder, wonder
who the other cartwheeler was.
You know, cartwheels!
The Director wants to see you
in his office.
Yes, of course.
Does anyone want to tell me
who the other cartwheeler was?
How about you?
Do you wanna tell me who it was?
I think you know who it is.
And I'll bet,
that if you give her this card,
she'll think about it
and fill it out.
Don't you?
Do you think it is possible
for a little girl to fly?
So do I.
Good morning, students.
Good morning, comrade Professor.
My name is Mili Simonescu.
I am from Bucharest.
On behalf of the
Romanian Gymnastics Federation,
I welcome you
to the very first class
in the training of very young
girls in a very old building.
Each of you
passed a difficult coordination
test to qualify for this training.
You are very special girls,
and I wish you
the best of success.
And now,
I turn you over to your coach,
Marta Karolyi,
who will be assisted
by her husband.
But first,
look what I've brought you
from Bucharest.
One for each of you.
Now!
Come on in!
The water's great!
You're supposed to be
one of the coaches,
not one of the children.
They like it.
I didn't bring you here
to be liked.
Sometimes people
just can't help themselves.
Papa!
Papa.
Papa!
Hold up!
It's Nadia Comaneci!
And how are you, young lady?
Okay.
Do you know what I have for you?
So...
You have a secret.
Tell me what it is.
No?
Well, let me see.
You found a pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow?
No, it didn't rain today.
Well...
I don't know what it could be.
Unless...
It couldn't be that?
It couldn't be
about the new school.
Yes, papa, yes!
No, you don't like it.
You don't like the new school?
This new school, you like it?
Oh, yes!
I love it, papa!
Look at my uniform.
It's beautiful.
We have such fun.
We run and jump into a big hole
filled with bouncy things.
A big hole filled
with bouncy things.
What kind of school is this?
Fancy outfits, but no books.
No pencils, no studies.
We did that, too, papa.
But in the gym,
we do all sorts of tricks.
Tricks!
That's what you do?
Tricks!
It's called tumbling.
I used to love it as a girl.
But, today,
it's a glamorous sport.
They give her free clothing
and two free meals.
How bad can that be?
I'll ask around.
Karolyi is a boxer,
what does he know about gymnastics?
No, his wife is the coach.
He helps her. They say
she is very good.
I don't like it.
Why are you
trying to make trouble?
Mama...
Oh, Stefania, you know
how these schools are!
Work, work, work.
No time to be a little girl.
This could be
a great opportunity for her.
Now what does that mean?
They say she
could be a champion.
Well, with me, she already is!
If you do anything
to spoil this for her...
For her?
Stefania,
for her?
Don't be mad, papa.
I'm not.
I just want what's best for you.
Guess.
Good morning, comrade Professor.
Professor?
Where is he?
He's coming.
Oh, dear!
Nobody came today!
Where could everybody be?
In here!
No.
Who's missing?
Nadia! Nadia!
Nadia, time to wake up!
There she is!
That was fun.
Now, shall we do
some serious work, Professor?
We have a new student
with us today.
Her name is Teodora Ungureanu
and she has just
moved to Onesti.
Teodora is eight years old,
and she has been performing
advanced gymnastics for two years.
So after our workout,
she will demonstrate
her floor exercise for us.
So everyone,
please welcome Teodora.
How can a little girl do that?
That's what comes from
serious work.
You're the best here,
aren't you?
I knew it.
Are you jealous?
I know.
It was beautiful.
Do you have a lot of friends?
Mostly boys.
Someday,
I'm going to marry the
handsomest man in the world.
How about you?
Someday,
I'm going to climb
the tallest tree.
Is that crazy?
I knew you'd understand.
Let's be friends forever.
Incredible.
There you go!
Bela!
Bela, get the gear.
Girls, stay here!
Hello, Mili, how are you?
Welcome to Sibiu.
Nicholae!
This is Marta Karolyi.
And this is comrade Vieru
of the Sports Association.
How do you do, sir.
Secretary General.
I hear you are making wonderful
progress with your little ones.
Well, we're trying.
And this, is Bela Karolyi.
Nicholae Vieru.
And these...
These are the little girls
from Onesti.
Adorable. Adorable.
Bela handles the bars
and the vault.
Undoubtedly.
Yes, well,
good luck to you all.
Good day, little ones.
Good day, Comrade.
He's very interested
in our Onesti program.
He sees you as the
bright stars of our future.
Yes, I can see that.
He's really a very nice man.
Competition days
make him nervous.
All right, inside, little ones.
Score, 9.50.
Nadia, do exactly
what you did in practice.
Don't let us down.
Go.
From Onesti,
Comaneci, Nadia.
Comaneci, Nadia.
Score, 7.25.
Don't cry about today.
I'm not crying.
I never cry.
You should.
So that I can tell you not to.
Nadia, the tragedy
isn't that you fell.
It's that you're the best
and didn't live up to it.
You completely lost
your concentration.
It will never happen again.
Never.
You're not serious
about gymnastics.
Yes, I am.
No, you're not. You're just playing,
you should quit.
No!
Did you ever see anyone
as bad as you were today?
No.
Neither did I, quit!
No!
Go back to the schoolyard and do
cartwheels if you just want to play!
No!
I want to be a champion.
I'll confess something to you.
I've been playing, too.
When I first found you,
I only knew four sports.
I wasn't even a real
gymnastics coach.
So I'll make a pact with you,
so we can both stop playing.
Instead of teaching you
what I don't know,
I want to teach you
what I do know.
I will teach you how to have
a runner's strength,
the cunning
of a handball player,
and how, like a boxer,
to be fearless of pain.
You interested?
I'm talking about a lot of work.
Total commitment,
total concentration.
Don't take up my time,
and then quit.
I'll never quit.
No one has ever worked as
hard as I am going to work you.
I shall work.
You do.
And you will be the best
in the world.
Concentrate, Nadia.
Forget the crowds,
the announcer, the judges.
Even your teammates and coaches.
Only the exercise.
You've almost got it.
But enough for tonight.
I can do better.
I'll keep working.
Nadia.
Oh, papa!
Good evening, Mr. Comaneci!
Hello.
Sorry.
It's getting late,
your mother worries.
I can't get her to quit.
My routine is not perfect.
Well, it does look good to me.
So come home.
No, papa.
I must do it once more.
Only once.
Swing, swing! Up, up!
It was good, wasn't it?
Get dressed, and go home.
Did you see, papa?
Yes.
Your mother's waiting.
She's getting very good.
I suppose.
Will all this make her happy?
Well, you just saw her.
I have to order her to stop.
I'll wait by the door.
I have a surprise for you.
What?
Tickets to the circus.
When?
Saturday.
But, papa,
I have to practice on Saturday.
Saturday.
I must.
Guess who was lonely
without you.
Who?
This funny little bear.
Oh, papa!
This is my favorite bear.
I'm so glad you came to see me.
He missed you very much.
Keep your legs straight.
Point your toes.
Point your toes,
point your toes.
Faster, faster.
Feet together.
Good, Nadia, good.
Good!
Marieanna!
Not like that.
You're not thinking
about your finish.
You must see it in your mind.
- Again!
- Let's do it again.
Good, point your toes.
Good...
Stay off the bar, stay off it!
No!
It's all right, it's all right.
Don't worry about Marieanna.
Now go back to your practicing. Go,
go!
Nadia, injuries happen.
Now go back to your floor
exercises and concentrate.
Go.
Bela,
I think you better
take her to the hospital.
Yes, I know.
They think it's a ligament.
The operation
is tomorrow morning.
Oh, Bela.
Her parents are furious,
they're taking her out of the school.
But it was no one's fault!
They say maybe we're asking
too much from such little girls.
Maybe they are right.
What do you mean,
the girls are doing just fine.
Bela, there's a little girl
in the hospital!
These things happen.
Where are your feelings?
I don't recognize you.
My feelings are in
every one of those girls.
Don't think I don't have
feelings, Marta.
I have too many feelings.
Bela, they're just little girls.
You remember how long a day took
when you were a child?
A week.
And a week lasted a month,
and a month lasted a year.
It was the time of life
when we were most alive.
As adults, we just
pay off the bills.
Yes, then we shouldn't try
to take it away from them.
Away?
Marta, I'm giving it to them.
How many of us ever experience
a silent moment
of radiant perfection?
Why shouldn't
they experience that
at the time of life
when they're most alive?
Bela.
It is our responsibility to keep
them from hurting themselves.
You can get well from an injury.
But you can't get the experience
unless you take the risk.
I still think
you're pushing too hard.
It's not the Olympics, you know.
It will be.
Canada, Marta.
We're going to Canada.
Bela!
Our girls are too young!
They haven't even won
a European event yet.
Yes, that's why
we're going to Paris first.
No, no, no.
They are not going to Paris.
They would be
laughed out of the arena.
They are the future!
The best we will have
for a long time.
Paris!
It's only an exhibition.
We have better girls.
Right here in Bucharest.
No, we do not.
Teodora is the only
promising one
and she was trained
by another coach.
Nico, you are the expert
for men, I for women.
Trust me.
We have no better girls here,
or anywhere else in Romania.
Karolyis are training champions.
That is another thing.
I really do not like
your man, Karolyi.
He is ruthless.
He will do anything to win.
Yes.
He will.
Isn't that wonderful?
So, Nadia,
how do you like Paris?
Wonderful, especially
the airport.
Romania!
Romanian gymnasts.
Romanian gymnasts, over here!
Comrade Professor, isn't there
somebody we could call?
I was told that someone
would meet the plane.
But that was two hours ago.
Do you speak French?
Neither do I.
Romania.
Romania.
Is there anyone here
for Romania?
Hello? Romanie?
Roma... Romania, yes!
Come on, quick, quick!
Somebody's here!
Taxi, taxi!
Come on.
Sports Palace.
No, no, monsieur.
You're not going
to the Palace of Sport.
What do you mean?
You have been assigned
to the secondary competition.
No.
We didn't come all the way
to Paris to hide.
Take us to the Sports Palace.
Monsieur...
They won't let you in Romania,
not with the babies.
They are not babies,
they are champions.
But, monsieur...
We go now!
Monsieur,
this uncivilized man
and his undersized wives
have the impudence
to request entrance.
Do you have anyone from
God-forsaken Romania on your list?
No, Monsieur.
Of course not.
As I knew all along!
Thank you, my friend.
Monsieur,
I tried my best,
but it's impossible.
I was sure it would be.
But thank you,
thank you very much for trying.
You must go now
to the small competition.
One moment.
Pardonne moi.
You girls stay close to me.
We're going in, okay?
Hey, look out!
We're coming through!
Out of the way!
No!
Monsieur!
Ladies and gentlemen,
from Russia,
ranked No. 1 in the world,
Ludmilla Tourischeva.
Stay down. Hide!
Get ready, but stay down.
My name is Bela Karolyi,
I'm from Romania.
Sit down.
Down. I have two gymnasts.
And I'm asking your permission
to enter them
into this competition.
Just two girls.
I just wanted to...
She's beautiful.
Ludmilla Tourischeva.
That concludes
the floor exercise.
Next, the balance beam.
No, no! One more, one more!
From Romania!
Nadia, now!
Hurry!
Let him go!
Watch her.
Watch her!
Attention please!
She is from Romania,
and she is 12 years old.
Her name is...
Nadia!
Nadia! Nadia! Nadia!
Well, my friend, we did it!
You'll take the papers
and TV now.
In Paris, Romanian gymnast,
Nadia Comaneci
won the hearts of the audience
in a surprise appearance.
Professor Bela Karolyi
stated that she is one
of many top-caliber gymnasts
currently training at his school
who will be competing at all
the upcoming European events.
That is blackmail.
But he is right!
One hundred sit-ups.
Begin!
And one.
And two.
And three.
And stronger! Four!
Stronger. Five!
And six.
Seven.
And eight.
And nine.
Ten. Legs straight.
You're late Theodora.
And eleven.
And chests up.
And thirteen.
And fourteen.
And fifteen. Stronger.
Sixteen. Chests up.
Nineteen. Twenty.
Faster. One...
Coach Karolyi says
he expects his students
to dominate the Romanian
team from now on.
How can he say that?
I don't know.
Thirty-two. Thirty-three.
Thirty-four.
Thirty-five. Thirty-six.
No cheating, Teodora.
Thirty-nine.
All right, enough, stop!
Girls, this is Geza Pozsar,
your new choreographer.
He is joining us to put
new life into your routines.
This will begin now.
Follow me.
No, no, no!
Not like that,
you'll break something.
Now go back and do it right.
Another delicious
carrot stick, my dear?
Which one is delicious?
Bela, Nadia gets
so intensely involved
when she performs,
she forgets the audience.
And she never thinks to smile.
Geza!
Teach her to smile.
What judge would like
such a sour-puss?
Nadia.
Smile.
Professor Bela Karolyi
confidently predicted victories
for his students
Teodora Ungureanu,
and Nadia Comaneci.
He is going too far.
Do you think so?
Ms. Comaneci, she has dominated
the 1974 Champions all competition,
with three gold medals
and one silver.
And her coach, Bela Karolyi,
is confident that
his students will carry off
several medals of the
1976 Olympic Games.
Nadia Comaneci
again wins the overall gold,
firmly establishing herself
as a major factor
in European woman's gymnastics,
as predicted by her colorful,
and sometimes outspoken coach,
Bela Karolyi.
For years, I have been
putting up with that ego-maniac.
He's winning.
I don't like him.
You like him to win, don't you?
Really whether
he likes it or not,
we are going to Montreal.
You must understand
Vieru's problem.
Bucharest is the capital.
It has the most
expensive facilities,
the most experienced coaches,
and supposedly,
the best gymnasts.
Does Bucharest win medals?
No, Onesti wins medals.
They don't expect medals.
Only the Russians win medals.
Is that why we have
worked so hard?
To be beaten?
No.
We have the best team in
the world right here in Onesti.
We deserve to go
to the Olympics.
Calm down, Bela.
I'm not your enemy.
I will do my best
to get you to Montreal.
But compromises will be made.
I'm not asking
for anything special.
I'm only asking
for what is fair!
My girls are best.
In this world,
to ask for what is fair
is to ask for what is special.
If we don't go,
I'll tell everyone why.
Including the press.
That would not be wise.
Tell me. Where are
all the wise coaches?
I don't know.
That's because you've
never heard of them.
Being wise is not
what we do best.
Would you like more, Mili?
Don't tempt me, Marta,
thank you.
Take care, Bela.
Don't push too hard.
That is what we do best.
Touch the floor.
Ninety-three.
Ninety-four.
Ninety-five.
Touch the floor.
You're late again, Teodora.
That's 200 sit-ups.
Why not make it 400?
Very good idea.
Make it 400.
Ninety-eight.
Ninety-nine.
One hundred.
Teodora.
I hate him.
I really do.
And, one.
And one.
And straight, and one.
Two, back.
Forward, mark, lift!
Plie, lift the arm.
Plie!
Bend, straight and lift,
and wide, check the wrist.
Plie, legs straight,
over, lift!
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to Montreal
and the 1976 Olympic Games.
What do you think?
Let's go home.
Teodora.
Teodora.
Over here.
Smell that food?
What is it?
I don't know.
But I like the way it smells.
Do you think they are
dancing down there?
Maybe.
I know they're eating, though.
I think we ought to
sneak down there, don't you?
Nadia, it's now or never.
Let's go.
Nadia, look at that boy's eyes.
All you think about is boys.
Look over there.
I think that guy likes you.
Nadia!
I really like that.
The Games start late,
because of the time zones.
It is six hours earlier there?
Look, Adrian.
There she is.
Don't let anyone's reputation
intimidate you.
All it means is that
they used to be good.
They must prove
that they still are.
They're still good.
Are you all right?
No, you're not all right.
What did you eat last night?
You went out, didn't you?
How could you,
today of all days.
It won't matter.
Next, on the Uneven bars,
Teodora Ungureanu.
Teodora Ungureanu,
9.90.
Where's Bela?
In the stands.
The stands?
The officials decided only
women coaches on the floor
during woman's events.
Next on floor exercise,
Krisztina Medveczky.
And now,
the next competitor,
Nadia Comaneci.
Papa!
Do you think it is possible
for a little girl to fly?
I'll never quit.
Nobody's here today.
It was good, wasn't it?
Don't let us down.
Nadia, concentrate. Forget
everything but the exercise.
Only one?
Now there seems
to be some kind of a problem.
The judges are conferring.
One moment, please.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think it is...
Yes, it is.
For the first time in the history
of the modern Olympic Games,
a perfect 10!
Ladies and gentlemen,
We are witnessing gymnastic
history in the making.
With her final bar routine,
Nadia Comaneci has achieved
an unbelievable seven perfect 10's.
Now she is receiving
her gold medal.
The overall individual champion of
gymnastics in the 1976 Olympic Games
from Romania, Nadia Comaneci.
Is it true that you
follow a very strict diet?
Would you like to have...
Did you mother and father
come to the Games?
No!
Have you got any movie offers?
A movie, a Russian movie.
My mother loved it.
Any boys have
proposed to you, yet?
Would you like
to have a boyfriend?
Why don't you ask me questions
about gymnastics?
This is the most prestigious
gymnasium in Romania.
No, the world.
And there she is.
The greatest gymnast
in the world.
Nadia Comaneci.
What do you call that?
My new floor routine.
Where are the hand gestures?
I'm not a little girl anymore.
I do not need the hand gestures.
Nadia, ever since Montreal...
I'm growing up, okay?
Can't you see?
Growing up?
You call arguing with your coach,
growing up?
Those gestures are childish.
I won't do them.
As long as you are
in my gymnasium,
you will do it my way,
do you understand?
Do you?
Yes.
Yes, what?
Yes, comrade Professor.
All right now, start again.
This is Teodora Ungureanu.
Out! Clear the gym,
all of you!
These are very important
guests of the government.
I don't care who they are.
But they have traveled here
from all over the world,
you cannot dismiss them.
They are not responsible
for these girls, I am!
And I want them out!
Bela, if you persist...
Out!
Bela, think it through.
No.
You think this through.
That flash nearly caused
an injury to one of my girls.
When we are training,
don't you bring anyone here
without my permission, not ever!
That was a very serious mistake.
Let us move on.
Not sure who's more excited about this,
her or me.
What is this?
Some papers we have to sign.
What papers?
To get Nadia away
from that awful man.
He starves her.
He overworks her.
He keeps her away from us.
He only wants
the glory for himself.
He does not think
about the girls.
Suddenly, everybody
is thinking about Nadia.
It is best for her, Gheorghe.
Well, maybe it's time
Nadia did retire.
Retire?
No, no, we are transferring
the entire team to Bucharest.
I will be personally
responsible for Nadia.
No!
Now she has done enough!
Gheorghe...
Do you have any idea
how important your
daughter is to the nation?
She gets thousands
of letters every week.
The whole world loves her.
It is true, it is true.
She is a national treasure.
We must do
what is best for Nadia.
With your permission, of course.
No!
No, Stefania!
No!
Nobody's here.
I'll get it.
Oh, dear.
Nobody's here today.
What shall we do?
Where could they be?
Here?
In here!
Come on, where are you?
Bela.
The girls.
They're gone.
What?
The team, they have been
moved to Bucharest.
That's impossible.
It's true, Bela.
But we're their coaches.
Not anymore.
Nadia, too?
All of them.
Family...
For nine years, Marta,
we were family.
Say! Nadia Comaneci.
Boys! Nadia Comaneci.
Hello.
Could we play?
Later, perhaps.
Find a place to stretch,
and welcome.
I'm George Condovici,
your new coach.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
Is it always like this?
Just to warm up.
The boys prefer soccer
to calisthenics.
What about the girls?
They stretch and then duck.
So, Nadia,
how do you like Bucharest?
Terrific.
Hi.
Come on in, have some beer.
I'm Spitzy.
Nadia, let me
introduce you around.
Hey, everybody!
This is Nadia.
You must be the other one.
That's me.
I'm Sorin.
Care to dance?
Love to.
Okay, let's go.
Why are you called Spitzy?
I look German.
Nadia, Nadia...
Nadia, Nadia...
This way.
Go!
They all recognize you.
Everybody.
You must be the most
famous person in Romania.
Ladies and gentlemen,
distinguished guests.
I propose a toast
to Romania's Olympic champion.
Little Ms. Perfect.
Nadia Comaneci.
Nadia! Nadia!
There she is again.
That's twice this week.
Three times.
At a state banquet
this evening...
She's having a wonderful time.
Why does she look so sad?
She doesn't look sad.
Well, what's wrong with her?
She is becoming a woman.
A spoiled woman, I'd say.
Well, she is in Bucharest,
where she belongs.
Oh, Nadia!
Would you like another
new dress, dear?
You must come!
Why, the President himself
is expecting you.
What about the rest of us?
Meatballs?
Speaking of food,
have you noticed how big
she's been getting lately?
Fat is the word.
I mean...
Fat is the word!
Nadia, hi!
We were just...
'Night! Good night.
Is that how you talk about
me when I am not here?
You tell everybody
I'm fat, right?
No...
Right?
I don't have to, Nadia.
Look at you.
You are fat!
I thought you were
my best friend.
That's what all the
newspapers say.
Well, aren't you?
You know,
I'm tired of being Nadia's best friend.
A lot of people think
that I am better than you are.
If you are better,
then why don't you win?
I do, when you're not around.
If you didn't exist,
I'd have been the star.
I'm not competing with you.
I've worked just
as hard as you have!
I deserve more!
You've got Bela.
He always chose you over me.
Bela hates me.
Then why did he spend all
of his time working with you?
And you walked out on him.
What about you?
He didn't care about me leaving.
It was always
Nadia, Nadia, Nadia.
I took an Olympic silver medal
right next to you and no
one even knows I was there!
It's not my fault if people
don't pay attention to you!
I wish they would!
I wish they'd leave me alone.
I'll be happy
to leave you alone!
Fine with me!
I don't need you!
Don't be my friend!
Don't be my friend at all!
Bucharest is so beautiful!
Parts of it are.
Nadia...
Adrian and I...
are moving to Bucharest.
Soon.
What about papa?
Your papa and I were...
We're getting a divorce.
It was bound to happen
sooner or later.
You've seen us fight,
and for Adrian's sake,
I had to. He'll be
much happier here.
Mr. Vieru has
arranged everything.
We'll be together.
Adrian and I, and you...
I'll miss Papa.
He'll stay in Onesti.
Well, he has his garage to run.
And his plum brandy.
How are the Karolyis?
You didn't hear?
They've moved to Deva.
Deva?
Are they starting over?
I suppose so.
The Onesti Council blames him
for losing the national team
and rightfully so.
I didn't even
get to say goodbye.
What?
Oh, nothing.
We'll have so much fun here.
It's a whole new life!
We could let her
find her own way.
Be patient.
Be patient?
I am the one who moved her here.
Remember?
She's not even training.
No, she is not.
For the first time
since she was six years old.
But she will.
She must.
I want you to confine her
to the dormitory.
And restrict her eating.
You want me to do that?
Yes. Now.
And...
No visitors.
Hi!
You're okay?
Go away.
You want me to spot?
Go away.
Just go away.
Go away!
Have it your way.
Where are you going?
To get juice, do you mind?
May I see Nadia?
No visitors.
What is this?
Solitary?
No visitors.
Solitary.
Now where?
Is Kurt there?
Do you know where he went?
Well, never mind.
Nobody home?
Why don't you leave me alone?
All of you.
Just go away!
Gabriella! Hi!
Come on, let's go for a walk.
Help!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Hey, she tried to kill herself!
Really, she tried
to kill herself!
Oh God! That's Nadia.
Nadia...
Come home with me.
Forget gymnastics.
You'll be happy.
Lead a simple life,
take walks.
Climb trees?
Yeah.
The taller the better.
I couldn't do it, papa.
Look at me.
I love you any way you are.
No, papa.
I'm so ashamed.
You don't be.
You're alive,
that's all that matters.
No, papa.
It isn't all that matters.
I have to be the best.
You've already done that.
Now that you are growing, there are
all kinds of things that you could do.
I have to train.
Harder than ever now.
Does Bela know?
Maybe not.
Bela's far away.
Emilia Eberle,
9.90.
It is another
gold medal for Deva,
and the Deva team
increases its lead over
the Bucharest national teams.
Just breathe!
Come on, we've got them.
They can't win!
Congratulations.
Thank you!
It is so good to
finally beat the national...
Hello, Bela.
How is our top coach?
Hello.
Any new Nadias on your team?
There will never be
another Nadia,
and even if I had one,
I wouldn't tell you.
Tell me about, say,
Emilia Eberle.
Emilia?
Yes.
Yes, you just saw her.
She will win another gold
before the evening is over.
Yes.
Impressive.
How old?
Twelve.
The whole team is 12.
They are harder to steal
when they are 12.
Bela, I wanted
to tell you personally,
that we at the Federation,
are very impressed
with the work that
you have done in Deva.
You should be.
Yes!
In fact,
we had a special meeting last night.
And?
And, well...
Under the circumstances,
we want you
to take over the national team.
No.
Bela, you are the best.
We need you.
Nicholae,
the World Championships
are five weeks away.
Five weeks!
How could I possibly
prepare a team in five weeks?
We want you to use your team
as the national team.
Deva becomes the national team?
Yes. Of course.
Plus, two from Bucharest.
Which two?
Teodora and Nadia.
And Nadia.
No.
Bela, Nadia is having some
problems and she needs you.
No, I won't do it.
She is the defending champion
and you are her coach!
Was her coach!
You stole her from me!
I was too rough, remember?
They left me eight months ago
without looking back.
Not a letter,
not a phone call, nothing!
Well, we have
started over in Deva,
and that is where we will stay.
You are defying the orders
of the Sports Federation?
Yes.
Keep your national team
in Bucharest.
On the Uneven bars,
from Deva, Emilia Eberle.
Can you believe it, Marta,
four gold medals!
Yes, I can believe it.
To the little ones.
The little ones.
Are you going to tell me?
Or do I have to ask?
You saw me talking with Vieru.
He wants you to take Nadia back.
And Teodora.
Are you going to do it?
Bela, he can close
our school down.
He can drive us out of coaching.
Yes, I know.
I know...
Who is it?
Yes?
Nadia?
Nadia?
Is that you?
Nadia?
How could that happen to her?
She's totally dependent on you.
What do you mean?
Bela, you didn't teach her
to control her appetite.
You took away her food.
Nadia is not dependent on me.
She is irritatingly independent.
She always fought with me.
And you always won.
Marta, I can't
be with her forever.
What will she do then?
That's a very good question.
Come on, come on,
four kilometers to go, come on.
Twenty-two, twenty-three.
Four!
High. High, higher!
Six, seven.
Eight.
Now remember you are
the defending World Champion
and you do not wish to
make a fool out of yourself.
Say it.
I'm the defending
World Champion.
I do not wish to make
a fool out of myself.
Wake up!
You let her get to the food!
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help myself.
You can't stand the
pressure of being a star.
Have some bread!
You want to self-destruct
so that nobody
will recognize you!
Then you have some butter on it!
Have some chicken!
Have some ham!
You want something to comfort
you when the going gets rough,
have some cottage cheese.
And when you are
through with this,
here's some money,
you go down to the ice cream parlor
and you buy desert!
So, why are you not eating?
I don't want to.
Good.
But from now on, Nadia,
it is up to you.
You cannot depend on me anymore.
I will teach you what to do.
But I can't make you do it.
And I won't do it for you.
Get up!
Please!
Get up, Nadia.
What?
What's wrong?
Just a scratch.
How did you do this?
It's my grips.
Sometimes, I raise a rash.
No, that looks infected.
I want you
to have this looked at.
Please, stop fussing.
I'm not a little girl anymore.
It happens all the time.
I want you to take care of that.
Okay.
Okay.
Come! Up!
No sauna tonight.
You go to bed.
I'll bring you a tray.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to the 1979
World Championships
in Fort Worth, Texas.
What? What now?
No, no, no.
This is bad.
You'd better get this
taken care of. Now!
We were this close
to beating the Russians.
As always.
If you hadn't been so careless.
Bela, please.
Careless?
Yes, careless and stupid!
You make it sound like my fault.
It is your fault.
I told you to take care of that.
You are no use to us like that.
Next on the vault,
Steffi Kraker.
From Romania,
Teodora Ungureanu.
Teodora Ungureanu,
9.25.
Next on the vault,
for the USA,
Christa Canary.
So, Nadia...
How do you like Fort Worth?
The judges were tough on you.
It was about right.
I usually do better.
Judges resent the fact
that little girls grow up.
Nadia, gymnastics has changed.
We're the ones that changed it.
What used to be special,
is now ordinary.
You and I, we can't compete
with ourselves anymore.
Next, from Romania,
Emilia Eberle.
I wanted to help the team win,
if I could.
But before Fort Worth,
I had already decided to retire.
It's tough being with a lot of
12-year-olds that are better than I am.
They're not!
Not all of them.
But they're getting better
and I'm getting worse.
It's time.
What will you do?
Join the circus.
Circus?
Yeah, it'll be fun.
And,
I'm going to marry the
handsomest man in the world.
Sorin?
He doesn't know about it yet.
But the circus, it was his idea.
I know you'll be happy.
Nadia.
Yes?
I'm sorry.
For what?
For being jealous.
You deserve all your wins.
I have often wondered
what would have happened
if Bela had chosen you at Paris,
instead of me.
So have I.
The Russians
are going to win again.
Emilia Eberle,
8.95.
What are you doing?
I will compete.
Next on the vault...
- I can't let you.
- Suzy Kellems.
What does the team need to win?
9.9.
Tell the judges I'm competing.
Are you sure?
Tell them.
Suzy Kellems, 9.75.
Nadia...
I'll stretch a bit.
Nadia Comaneci
will perform today.
More.
I understand now.
You do?
I can do it on my own.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
a surprise entry, for Romania,
Nadia Comaneci!
What did you do to her?
For the first time,
nothing!
Yeah!
Nadia Comaneci, 9.95.
We did it!
We're number one!
Ladies and gentlemen,
the winners of the
1979 World Championships,
Romania!
Nadia! Nadia! Nadia!
