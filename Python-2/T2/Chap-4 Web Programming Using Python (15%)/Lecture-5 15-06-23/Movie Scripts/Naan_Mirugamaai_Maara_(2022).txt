CHENNAI!
DURAI!
PRISON!
CHOLAN!
Dheena! Look at these boys, they
seem to be sharp and skillfull
Toilet door opens
A man knocks
Footsteps approaching
Knocking repeats
Hey! Why are you






peeping at my poop ?
I Need dope.
Are you Ratnam ?
Why the hell should I give you ?
RATHNAM!
You look like a kindergarden
and asking for dope uh!
What are you staring at ?
Just because you
killed a security and
committed a robbery
you aren't a gangster
Get lost now!
Machines whirring!






Everybody out now.
Its time to eat.
Ratnam Struggles!
Struggling Continues..
Are you Ratnam?
A whistle sound heard!
Being such a small brat
you killed off Ratnam itself.
Look at his eyes man! Stares
like he doesn't fear anything
The most costliest
thing on earth is life
Don't just do it for food
and fuel, Do it for money
Will make arrangements
for your release
Meet my men outside,
they will give you the hit list.
Do your killings there and
you get paid accordingly.
Will you do it ?
OK Will do it.
Durai ?
-Yes
Welcome Durai. How's Doss?
He's Good
-Mmmm
In a month's time Government
is declaring a new tender
This person Deveraj shouldn't
be alive to take that tender
Since his arrival I
lost all my contracts
That annoying man
Devaraj should die
Here is your advance.
He should be stabbed
for a minimum of 25 times
Get the job done Durai
-Your balance will be settled.
Make sure my
name isn't involved.
Well educated and trained
professionals
involved, Not to worry.
Good!
KANAGU!
Bring those boys
who killed the security
in the college
robbery for a trial
Locker opens!
When I was taking the money,
sensed someone was watching us.
Turned around and it was the
security, Durai
hid by the bureau
Open the door
Hey come here!
Security started
his search by turning
around his torch
to the right and left
Then when came near
bureau
Then he started to shout
once he saw the bureau opened
Hey who's that ? Come out!
Durai Jumped and held
the security from behind
Security muffles and struggles!
As Durai was
holding the security
I was taking the balance cash
Security muffling and struggling
Durai tried to convince him
Durai offered him money
to keep himself quiet
I was worried if he may betray
us once the money is over.
Hence I had to kill him.
Ratnam Struggles Blood
splashing everywhere!
Kanagu grunts
The most costliest
thing on earth is
life Don't just do
it for food and fuel,
Do it for money. Will make
arrangements for your release
Meet my men outside,
they will give you the hit list.
Do your killings there and
you get paid accordingly.
Will you do it ?
OK will do it.
Kanagu is that fine?
Give me a smoke!
Kanagu We've got
a golden opportunity
We are settled once we do this
Who is the target?
Should be a perfect execution
Someone should work
from outside, So you stay out.
We'll take care of it.
He is DEVARAJ!
DEVARAJ!
He is our target
-He comes to the park
at 5.15AM every morning!
-His best friend
picks him up everyday
-He takes an early walk because
he doesn't like being disturbed
-Thats the right
time to finish him!
Because the park
gets busy by 6 AM
-Don't underestimate
him for his age
Finish him off
at the first strike.
Its totally under
CCTV surveillance
So never unmask
your face at any cost
Then its easier for the
stray dogs to identify us,
Better Be careful.
(Dogs Howling)
One small evidence is
enough for the cops to trace us
Who wants to volunteer ?
ME !
Naga, You do it.
Naga acknowledges!
Is that OK ?
Good choice Kanagu,
take these drugs
Keep the boys drugged
until the job is done
Make sure they are
high always Mmm...
Why you want us
high before the crime ?
Its like a 'Horse Tack' to
keep us focussed on our target
Once we take this
drug and fix the
target in our mind
till we finish the job
-Target's image
never leaves our mind.

mill owners to have competitors
Sathish...Ask
everyone to come inside
Sir!Their last
target was Devaraj,
guess he could've done it.
Devaraj is not that
kind of a person
Devaraj in the
sense, not him directly
he could've hired another gang
My first suspect is Bhoomi
I'm Pretty sure its not
him, he is scared of
these guys. What do
we tell the press now ?
Tell them its a gang war.

He is accompanied by
his men until he meets her,
Once he meets her all his
men are back to their cells.
When he is done,

and slit his throat
from the inside.
If we fail, then
he will finish us.

No Daddy, He tore
my friend Sara's book

Dad, come lets eat now.
He tore my friend Sara's books
also, so I guessed it to be him
I don't have an enemy to say so
Devaraj doesn't know
who did this to him
Those cruel animals should
be hanged to death Sir.
Already there are 3 murder
cases registered on them.
Who could be the other
victims affected by this gang ?
Sir is not here,
How can I help you?
I called him and
he didn't attend,

convey anything to him Sir ?

same gang who killed
my brother were
involved in 3 other cases
