So Joan,

here are the charges.

Listen to them all and be wise,
for God's sake!

First:

You fought near Paris
on God's holy day.

Second:

You jumped from the tower of Beaurevoir castle
in an attempt to put an end to your life.

Third:

You are guilty of Franquet
d'Arras' murder.

Fourth:

- Beware, bishop!
- Fourth!

- You've fixed this trial.
- Fourth!

You wore - and are still wearing -
men's clothes.

You will soon die, bishop!

I know that! Beware!

That's witchcraft!
She's a witch! A witch!

Throw her in the fire!
Write that in the report.

There's no need!

Get to the point, Joan!

Very good!

Firstly: what has God's
holy day got to do with Paris?

Whether it's a sin or not, is not
a decision for the Court,

but for my confessor.

Secondly: it was not despair
which drove me to jump from the tower.

On the contrary, it was hope!

And thirdly: as for Franquet d'Arras,
he got what he deserved.

He confessed to being a scoundrel,
a villain and a traitor.

I wanted to exchange him for Monsieur D'Orsay,
an adherent to my side.

But Monsieur D'Orsay died.

It would have been stupid to let
that scoundrel Franquet go free.

And men's clothes?

Don't you understand, bishop,

that being among men,

it is more decent to wear men's clothes?

Let me go back home to my mother,

and I'll return to her in a woman's gown.

For the last time, Joan...

Will you submit to the Church?

I won't.

I will not submit to you, my judges.

Very well.

Show the instruments of
torture to the accused.

Be humble, my daughter!

Do you fear death?

You fear?!

I do.

I fear it.

Very much.

My flesh trembles at the very idea.

I quake because of it.

But my soul...

doesn't belong to you.

It is stronger than torture and death.

And even if I tell you what you want to hear under torture...

I will only declare later that you extracted it from me by force.

Remember that.

Stop!

Sound take! Wait!

Sound take!

Stop!

Shooting's over, comrades!
Thanks a lot!

Comrades! Your attention!

Go to the canteen for a 30 minute lunch.

The buses will take you right there.

You can buy tickets at the cashier.

Today's extras will of course
receive their money tomorrow.

Today's lunch will be...
hmm, cabbage soup, I'm afraid.

And cutlets... with potatoes.

- Miss, do you dance?
- I do.

Do you mind?

- Do you dance?
- Of course!

May I?

Of course!

You dance?

I do.

And I sing!

- Wait here, I'll be back soon.
- Where are you going?

I won't be long.

- I won't be waiting.
- Wait!

Miss, do you dance?

Me?

Of course! Are you surprised?

Surprised? Not in the least!

Shall we dance?

Let's go!

Does it hurt?

Oh no, on the contrary,
it's even pleasant. And you?

Pleasant too. You know, that smarts.

Thanks.

- Thanks.
- Let me take them to the cloakroom...

It's better if I go myself.

You know, these bags and umbrellas are not mine so I'd rather take them myself. 
- Don't you trust me?
- Oh yes! Very much.

Please wait for me!
Please. Will you?

- Well, as you wish!
- I'll be back soon, I won't be long!

I'm back!

What's your name?

- Mine? Arkady.
- And mine's Pasha!

- Shall we dance?
- Let's dance!

The ball is over.
Good night, comrades!

What do they mean 'over'?

It can't be 'over'?
That's impossible!

- It's already quite late!
- What are you saying! Late?!

It's not late at all.

They could have warned us!

- Music!
- Music!

Music!

Don't make a fuss. The ball is over!
Good bye!

Well, Pasha! Is it worth shouting?

Yura, let's play 'Tsiganochka'.

Music!

Shall we dance?

- What is it?
- Nothing.

Come on, tell me.

Nobody has ever danced with me
like this. You're the first.

Will you dance again with me?

- Dance?
- Some day. 
Sure!

I suppose you find me attractive?

I suppose.

Really?
Aren't you afraid of me? 
- Of you?
- Of me.

- No, I'm not.
- Why not?

I won't say! 
- I know why.
- I don't think so!

- Because I don't make impression.
- On the contrary! You're charming!

- Really?
- Most charming, in fact.

That's true!
A lot of people say so!

You know, you're perceptive.
I even like you a little!

Praskovya!

Ivan Sidorovich proposed to me!

- You don't say!
- Today.

- And you?

- I said yes!
- Will there be a wedding?

- Of course!
- When?

- In the autumn.
- Why not sooner?

Well, we need to be sure of our feelings.
It's for life, after all!

Oh, Valechka, my dear!
Congratulations!

Thank you.

A souvenir for you.

- How does he get along with Boris?
- Marvellous!

- Does he love him?
- And how!

Tell me, Valentina!
Such a respectable man!

- Of course!
- And not bad at all!

- Have you kissed each other?
- Oh no!

Why not?

Because...I shouldn't.

I'm weak.

I faint.

That's strange.

It isn't strange.

You're right, anyway.

- That's not the main thing.
- Of course.

Valechka, darling!

Can you look after my precious?

Bring him in.

Where on earth is he?

Borya! Bor!

Boris!

What have you done now?

Come on. Don't test my patience.
You know my limits!

Well, come on!

Come on, come on!

He takes after his father. Sit there, in the corner!

And stop giggling!

Like this!

Praskovya!
Have a look!

Mini.

Oh, Valya.

It's lovely.

Very handy. But short!

Yes, but also impressive. 
- Really?
- Of course.

Okay, I'm off.

Go, take care of yourself.

Come here, please!

My God! What's that?

Jam.

Jam? Look at me!

Hide the jar.
He's well-fed as it is.

- Praskovya, I'm hungry.
- What?

- I'm hungry.
- Go wash your hands then.

Sit in. That's it.

No, one doesn't begin with jam.

Yes.

Coming.

Eat up. Don't move.

Listen, Praskovya!

Come here, I have something to tell you.

May I bring a girl to your place...to study physics?

What?

Physics. To study.
To get into the institute.

- No. Impossible.
- Just an hour or so.

Impossible.

Well, thank you.
We'll see you in a minute.

Don't you see, we're getting ready?

Turn around.

Borya, I tell you!

Praskovya, have you read 'The Novice'?

I have.
Turn around Borya.

And Lord Byron?

I have.

- Have you read everything?
- No.

I've read everything.

Have you?

Come on.

Borya, get out of here!
Listen, Borya!

I told you!
Come on.

- Borya, please.
- Excuse me, please. 
So what do you think?
I have good taste, don't I?

Yes, but you lack a conscience.

- Toma! Tamara!
- I'll tell your mother everything! 
I begged you to leave!

- Why are you laughing, you little pest?!
- Pest yourself!

- What's new in physics?
- I don't know,

- I'm a zootechnician.
- Interesting.

- And you?
- I'm weaver at the factory.

- Aren't you surprised?
- By what?

By the suddenness!

- Of what?
- Of our encounter.

- I'm not surprised.
- Why not?

- You've been following me for two hours!
- Really? - Really!

- But it wasn't me.
- Who was it, then?

I don't know!

- I know.
- Who?

You!

Do you like the theater?

I do, so what?

I like it very much too.

- Hi!
- Hello!

- I'm performing at the club. In a show.
- Who are you playing?

Baba-Yaga the witch.

Pash!
Hello!

- Where have you been these last three days?
- I've been working.

- And in the evening?
- At home.

- Have you been working too?
- No, resting. Why?

I've been waiting to dance with you.

I live here.
Up on the second floor.

- With your mother?
- No, with my wife.

So you're married?

I am.

And you have children?

A daughter.

Do you love your wife?

I do.

Ha!

Well, I'm going then.

See you.

See you.

Funny girl.

Do you dance?

I do.

Do you mind?

What it is, Arkady?

Nothing!

Domestic problems.

Things happen.

Let's dance to the next number too!

Well.

I don't mind.

Good bye.

Impossible.

Why?

It's banal.

Nonsense.

Come in, come in.
It's cold out there!

Arkady!

You're endangering my reputation.

- What am I doing wrong?
- Nothing.

- Hello, Mr. Sasha!
- Excuse me.

You surprise me.

Well, won't you come in?

- I will.
- So come in.

Here's the newspaper...

... which you may read.

Do you want some coffee?

- It will wake you up.
- I do.

I want some too.

- Hello!
- Hello!

- Does Arkady live here?
- Yes.

Are you his wife?

Has something happened to him?

Nothing, everything's fine.
He's sleeping at my place.

- At your place?
- Yes.

He sat down on the couch
and fell asleep.

What do you mean 'asleep'? 
Just that. He was tired.

- And who are you?
- I'm Pasha Stroganova.

So, don't you worry.
He's all right.

- Good bye.
- Where are you going?

To sleep at a friend's place.

Wait a moment. Maybe you could stay here.

- Oh no, that's not right.
- On the contrary.

Stay here.

- Stay, stay.
- As you wish.

Where did you spend the night?

What do you mean where?
At Victor's.

- Are you telling me the truth?
- Of course!

Where are my slippers?

In the bedroom.

- In the bedroom?
- In the bedroom.

Good heavens, it's Pasha!

- Pasha!
- Pasha!

- What was that for?
- Pasha!

That's not very friendly.
I'll tell you everything.

Pack your things and beat it!

- Again?!
- I've had enough of you!

Zina, Zina, don't do that!
You'll regret it later.

Zina!

Beat it!

That's everything!

Where will I go? Onto the streets?

Out!

- Fine, I'll leave!
- Out!

Stop!

Stop him!

No way!

You're not being fair to him!

Arkady!

Hey, can't you hear me?

Can't you see I'm running after you.

Clear off.

Don't be sad.

You'll be fine.
Everything'll get back to normal!

Comrades, quick.
Give him a seat.

Give me your suitcase!

Come and have dinner.
I'll wait for you after work.

Arkady!

Come in.

So I came, you see.

I'm glad.

Please. Come in.

Sit down.

Let's have dinner.

Now? At once?

Why wait?

You're back from work, so am I.

Let's have some wine.

Come on.

Pour me some.

Thank you.

Come on, don't be shy.

To the brim.

May life be full and joyful.

Help yourself.

Salad, fish...

poultry, caviar.

For dessert, there will be
champagne and fruit.

Followed by coffee and chocolates.

Come on, help yourself.

Game can be eaten with the hands.

Put it on your plate.
That'll be easier.

Here it is.

I won't get through it alone.

I'll help, don't worry.

And now, let's have some music.

- Do you recognize this?
- Of course.

Arkady!

Pash, we should register for some of Dickens' books.

Okay.

I bought you a tie.

Oh!

Thanks.

Come in.

Hi.

Pash, can I speak to you a minute?

- Hello.
- Hello.

Oh, who's this?
Oh, Boriska!

Will you look after him?

No. I can't today.

Arkasha is at home.

And tomorrow?

Tomorrow too.

He has a lot of work.
He's tired.

I see.

- Come on.
- I won't.

Valya! Val!
Wait a second.

You're driving me nuts.
You understand?

Yes.

Boriska.

Come on. We'll do
without your sweets.

Pash. Let's buy a standing lamp.

Okay.

And a fur coat.

I have one already.

That'll make two.

My falcon.

Arkasha.

Yes?

Don't make fun of me, please.

You know,

Arkash,

I will be an actress one day.

A great actress.

You don't believe me?

Believe me.

Believe it, darling.

Believe it, my little boy.

Hello.

Well, what do you want?

Get out!

Don't get distracted.

He's waiting.

What do you want?

Praskovya! Everything will be settled today. It's now or never.

- Give me your keys.
- No.

- Someone's waiting.
- I don't care.

And don't bring her here again.

Her?! She has a name and she's not just anybody. She's my fianc?e.

I don't care. Don't come back.
From now on I'm married!

- You!?
- Yes, me.

But he's married!

So what?

He has a daughter!

So what?

You're such a bitch!

You're being rude, Pavlik.

Very rude.

Gimme the keys!

Hello!

Hello.

* I'm a little daredevil girl. *

* who's not afraid of chores. *

* And on my broom through doors, *

* I jump, rock and whirl. *

* A rat or a cat, I can be. *

* And I can fly like a dove *

* Singing with the boys I love,
Once turned into a queen of beauty. *

* I'm on fire, I'm all ablaze; *

* I'll lure whoever you want, *

* Casting spells, with a chant *

* or just my smile and gaze. *

What do you want?

One can just slip in here.

Hello. Are you Pasha?

- And who are you?
- I'm a film director.

Let's get acquainted.

Do you want to appear in films?

- As Baba Yaga?
- No, not as Baba Yaga.

Yes I do. Why do you ask?

Do you know about Joan of Arc?

Of course. Who is she?

- A French girl?
- A national heroine.

Of course I know her. Why?

That's good.

We'll give her a screen test.

- A what?
- Screen test.

Oh.

Is there any point?
I'd agree without the test.

Why is he laughing?

Pay no attention.

It's okay. I agree.

But I'm not a professional actress.

That's fine. That's just what I'm looking for.

- I'm not attractive.
- Perfect.

- And I'm married.
- And I know that already.

- Who told you?
- A little bird.

- No, really. - Pasha,
I already know everything about you!

So, you're interested in me?

- We're interested!
- Yes!

Who is he?

- Odinokov!
- Second director.

- It means you're the first.
- I am.

Well? Do you agree?

Do you have any documents?

Of course.

Here you are.

Comr. F. V. Ignatev
Profession: Director.

Here's mine. 
I don't need yours.

Why has it expired?

Indeed.

Arkasha!

I'm going to be in a film!

Pash, we're not alone.

Hello, young lady.

You'll excuse me but
I came to take my husband back.

Sweet walks, smooth talks
and that's enough.

Arkasha!

Tomorrow is the 1st of September.

Our daughter is back from camp
and she's waiting.

Family.

Someone dressed you up here.

Only new things.

I thought that the neighbours were lying.

Everything's ironed and mended.

You should marry.
You'd make a good wife.

He's slovenly at home,

between you and me,

as one woman to another.

So where are...
your slippers?

On my feet.

- Don't shout!
- I'm not.

- Fine, you're not.
- You see.

Maybe some other thing got lost here.

Oh, you see.

I won't let him go!

You're a hooligan, young lady!

- Beat her!
- Zina, don't touch her!

- Let me go! - Arkasha!
- Let me go!

She's not worthy of you!

Oh, look at the woman he found.
Look at that mug!

Pash, don't listen to her!
She's crazy! I'm yours!

Arkasha! Come back!
I'm waiting for you!

Sit down!

Eat!

Who was it?

Just a neighbour.

- Well, I'm going out.
- Don't even think about it.

I'm capable of anything.

Eat.

I'm not hungry.

Pavlik, let's go.

Praskovya, what's wrong?
Have you lost your mind?

Pavlik. Let's go.

Come on, give it to me.

Good, good.

Calm down.
Calm down.

Here, you're a kind girl.

Oh! What have you got there?

Look. Did you cut yourself?

Oh. What's this?

It's nothing. Remain calm.
Everything will be okay.

Like this.

How do you feel now?
Come on.

Let's sit down...

...and drink some tea!

Sit down.
Sit down.

Remain seated.

Tomka! Tea!

What's the matter?

My little...my little...

Stand up, Joan!

And answer your judges'
questions standing!

So, Joan...

You believe that the real miracle
on earth is man. 
Yes, sir.

The man who is woven of sin,
mistakes, failure and weaknesses.

But also strength, valiance and purity.

- You maintain this?
- Yes.

- You're taking too much
upon yourself, Joan! - No, sir!

I saw all of this at war.

So you acquit man!

You consider him as one
of the greatest divine miracles.

I do.

You're blaspheming, Joan!

Man is dirty, mean
and indecent.

Yes, sir. Man sins.

He may be despicable.

Then for an unknown reason
he throws himself in front of a bolting horse, 
to save a child he doesn't know...

and dies with broken bones, peacefully.

He dies like a beast, in his sin.

No, sir.

He dies radiant with joy; pure!

And God waits for him, smiling.

I'm here.

Oh! Who's that?

Girls! My dear ones!

- Darling little things!
- Pashka!

You came!

- Hello!
- Valentinushka!

Come in!

Come in!

Girls, it's splendid to see you!

So lovely here.

Pasha.

So, tell me...

Why did they cast you in this film?

Why not some actress?

There are so many good ones.

Their faces are all over the walls of the club.

That's because, Katyun, Joan of Arc
and I are very much alike.

- What do you mean?
- It's very simple.

She's a girl of the people and
I am a girl of the people.

So what? I'm a girl of the people too
and so is Valentina.

We're all girls of the people.

Joan of Arc and I have a similar acuity and character.

A similar what?

Acuity and character.

Ah, I see.

- And the same face.
- The same?

- And the same figure.
- And the figure too?

- Impossible.
- Possible!

- Where did you learn that?
- People say so.

- Who?
- Competent people.

Incredible!

* He's wearing golden epaulets, *

* bright decoration on the chest! *

Ivan Sidorovich calls me
Nefertiti, by the way.

You have such a tender man, Valya.

So tender.

He is what he is.

He loves me very much.

How can one not love you?

Ah, Pashka, Pashka.

What a path you have chosen.

And yet you were like all of us.

What nonsense.

Why? She'll go abroad!

She'll have loads of fans.

You are so fortunate!

Yes, girls - I am fortunate.

Very fortunate.

I'll play many roles.

The hardest ones.

I want to play Mary Stuart.

- Who's she?
- A queen.

She was beheaded.

- What? Completely?!
- Completely.

What for?

For her lover.

Incredible!

I'd play her too.

So would I.

You know, girls, I'll make
my mark in art.

You'll see. Mark my words.

Then my Arkasha will admire me.

He'll come back to me.

Believe me, girls.

- He'll come back without fail.
- Of course.

Pasha!

How are you getting on
with your role?

- My role?
- Yes.

- Just fine.
- Tell us.

What can I say?
You'll see for yourselves.

They'll let us in?

Of course. We'll all go together,
and they'll let us in.

Incredible.

* Someone is walking down from the hill. *

* My beloved is probably coming. *

* He's wearing his soldier's blouse. *

* His blouse will drive me mad. *

* He's wearing his soldier's blouse. *

* His blouse will drive me mad. *

Joan,

our prodigal daughter.

Please, sign.

Why are you addressing me gently?

I'm talking to you
as God commands me.

God is good.

God is good.
But you are not.

Let it be that way.

Sign.

I won't sign anything.

- Sign.
- I won't!

Is this good behavior, Joan?

Sign.

No!!!

Why are you being so stubborn?
What for?

You know your King won't save you.

- That's not true.
- It is.

It's true because he betrayed you.

He didn't.

- My King did not betray me.
- Yes, he did.

We have already proved it to you.

And you agreed yourself
that your King had betrayed you.

It was a moment of weakness.
I regret it.

He betrayed you anyway.

It just means that
this was necessary to France.

That's all the rushes?

Yes. Seven reels.

What can I say, comrades?
In my opinion, it's a disaster.

In my opinion, it's good.

Well, I don't know.

We asked you; begged you, didn't we?

Not to cast her in the leading role.

Cute little faces make me sick. 
That's not the problem.

Is this Joan of Arc?

Some tramp?

As the scriptwriter, I insist
that she be replaced.

She's irreplaceable.

I see.

Why are there visitors in the room?

- Why are there visitors in the room?
- Hmm?

Why are there visitors in the room?

What visitors?

Girls, please leave immediately.

- Girls, stay seated.
- What do you mean "stay seated"?

I'm asking you to leave.

- But they're with me.
- With you or not it's all the same.

Please leave.

It doesn't matter, Praskovya.

Don't worry. Come on, Katerina.

- Quick!
- Don't worry.

Quick, girls! Hurry up!
Come on, come on!

Faster!

Girls, wait for me!

Praskovya Ivanovna!
You can stay!

Get lost!

What are you up to, Valentina?

Oh, please. Do I have to travel
in my chic dress?

Let me get changed in peace.

Move over.

Just don't lose your pride.

They're not worthy of you.
You've got real talent!

You're a genius, Pasha.
A genius!

The way you embody the character
is so unique.

I'm so moved.
Oh, sorry.

How about staying actually?
We're still on holiday.

Quiet!

I am quiet!

Well, where are you going?

Home, to Rechensk!

Stop talking nonsense. 
What the hell?
Are you a child or what?

Girls, get out!

- Don't touch me!
- And I'm not touching you!

- What the hell is going on?!
- Praskovya, we're waiting for you.

I'm coming.

- You're not going anywhere!
- We'll see.

I won't let you go.

Let me go!

I won't let you go, Pasha!

All right!

Watch out!

Hack!

You're hysterical!

I'll complain!

- Have you seen a girl?
- No.

- Put it here.
- Please.

My God! He's a lunatic.

Just wait and see!

- Let me go! - Pasha!
- Let me go! Help!

- Calm down!
- Let me go!

- You can't do this!
- Let me go, you idiot!

Girls, I'm going with you!

- Put her things into the car, quick!
- Let me go!

You rotter; little weaver!

You director!

Go to hell!

Just wait and you'll see!

Run, run!

Come on, come on!

- Mister, you can't go in.
- What are you saying!

- Please.
- Stand back please!

Again, again.

Move away.

I can't.

- My hands bother me.
- Just don't think about them.

Let's try again.

O my Lord, Saint Michael!

O Ladies, Saint Katherine and Margaret!

Why aren't you speaking to me?

Why have you forsaken me in such loneliness?

And for what? Why?
Why don't you say something?

I forgot my line.

O my Lord, Saint Michael!
O Ladies, Saint Katherine and Margaret

Why aren't you speaking to me?
Why have you forsaken me in such loneliness?

You were standing alongside me
when you led me to victory.

But you're so...
I can't. It doesn't work.

Why doesn't it work?

I don't know.

And who will know?

I've been spending so much time with you on this!

Answer me at once. What's the problem?

It's so simple, Pasha!

- What is bothering you?
- My hands.

And how can we get out of this situation?

What about shooting with
another actress instead of me?

- What?
- Another actress!

Really!
I'll give way.

Why are you laughing?
I'm serious.

And how do you suggest we do that?

Very simple.

You just cast another actress in my place.

Give her my wig.
Dress her in my clothes.

I'll stand in profile,

and her back will face the camera.

You, well...the camera shoots her...

Your hands are bothering you?
Right now?

- No.
- Why not?

Because you weren't thinking about them!
That's why.

Thank you.

Can we finally get started now?

No. It's better this way.

So do it this way!

No! They're bothering me!

They're bothering me!

They're bothering me!
Fyodor Vassilievich, they're bothering me!

Let me go! I'm not crazy!

Fyodya, stop this please.
You can't behave this way!

Get me a saw!

My hand isn't bothering me!

What for?

No need! I've got it!

Quick, quick, quick!

So!

O my Lord, Saint Michael.

O Ladies, Saint Katherine and Margaret.

Why aren't you speaking to me?

Why have you forsaken me in such loneliness?

- You were standing alongside to...
- What's that? - Wait, wait!

O my Lord, Saint Michael!

O Ladies, Saint Katherine and Margaret!

What is it now?

Can I look at a picture?
It will be better.

Okay.

Vitaly Alekseich!
Odinokov!

I'm here.

Hurry them, hurry them!

Somebody bring a picture quickly!
What's going on?! My God!

They're bringing it.

It's okay like this?

Extras in position!

O my Lord!

Saint Michael!

O ladies, Saint Katherine and Margaret!

Why aren't you speaking
to me anymore?

Why have you forsaken me
in such loneliness?

You were standing alongside me when you led me to victory.

But I need you more in my affliction!

Oh my God, I'm not that clever and
it's so hard to sort everything out alone.

- Are you ready?
- Yes!

Let's start!

Attention, camera!

Motor!

- Done!

Action!

O my Lord, Saint Michael!

O Ladies Saint Katherine and Margaret!

Why aren't you speaking
to me anymore?

Why have you forsaken me
in such loneliness?

You were standing alongside me
when you led me to victory.

But I need you more in affliction!

Oh my God, I'm not that clever.

And it's so hard to sort everything out alone!

My Lord,
Saint Michael!

- Help me in this difficult moment.
- Come back, girls! Don't you hear!

Cut! Done!

Congratulations!

Thank you, everyone.

That's a wrap!

- How do you feel, Pasha?
- Just fine.

- Tell me, how long will it be
on screen? - 13 seconds!

- That's all?
- That's not so short.

That's how it goes.

Hello!

Have you seen our Praskovya?
She's disappeared.

Let me go!

Of what crimes are they guilty?

Desertion.

- Where's your weapon?
- There.

And yours?

I don't know.

Why not? Answer!

- Why not?
- I was frightened. That's why!

Joan, I beg you. Be merciful.
I won't do this again.

Joan, I beg you! Joan!

Hang the traitors!

Both of them?

Both of them.

Joan!

Witch, witch!

It's time to leave, Joan!

What's wrong?

I'm afraid.

It's time to leave, Joan.

- Horse.
- Horse!

Those who believe in me...

Follow me.

Hello.

You want to see me?
Sit down.

What about work?

- Whose work?
- Mine.

- Mine.
- There's no request by your name.

- Why not?
- Why not? I don't know.

Strange.

What's strange?

Strange.

What should I do?

Have a look in the personnel department.

I've already been there.
They sent me to you.

To me? My God!
What were they thinking?

Yes? Yes.
I'm listening and writing it down.

Alright, I'll hold.

Did you speak to
Fyodor Vasilievich?

- Who?
- Your director. He might help you.

He's in the sanatorium now.
For treatment.

- Did he promise you anything?
- Yes.

But that won't be anytime soon.

Well, unfortunately, there's nothing I can do for you.

But if something comes up,
we'll write to you.

So nobody needs me now?

Not for the time being.

You did a great job.
You played your role beautifully.

But you're a very specific type. For the time
being, we've no need for girls like you.

Strange.

- Can I go home?
- Yes, of course.

It seems, your ticket
has been ordered already.

Strange.

- How strange everything is. Good bye.
- Good bye.

Good bye.

- All the best.
- Good luck.

Rechensk, comrades,
Rechensk station!

- Miss, the exit is on the other side.
- Yes, I know.

- Miss!
- I know, I know.

Rechensk stop, five minutes.
Rechensk station.

Pasha! Pash!

- Hi!
- Hello!

Praskovya!

You, well I came to...

...welcome you home!

Why are you alone?

Where are the others?

Don't be afraid.
They won't catch up with us now.

They'll be sulking,
but they won't catch up with us!

You know,
that I came back permanently?

Of course! I know everything.

- I came back to stay.
- Just great.

- Where did you hear that?
- Valka said so.

And how does she know?

They phoned you.

- Where did they phone?
- Well!

Your...what do you call it...

- ...organisation.
- The studio?

Well!

Oh!

What is it?

- They probably feel offended.
- They'll get over it.

You know, Tomka and I...

...got married!

Congratulations!

They gave us a room.

- Congratulations.
- More importantly,

I was accepted at the Institute.

Congratulations.

Thank you.

It's open!

- She's alive!
- Praskovya!

Oh, my little Boris!

Come on, come on!

Girls, she's here, come quick!
Pasha! Where were you?

Attention!

Speech! Speech!

Champagne flows like a river
in our dear Praskovya's honour! 
- Hello.
- Hello.

Remember me?

How could I not?

How could I forget?

Please.

- Come in.
- Is Arkady home?

No, he's at a meeting.
In school.

Then can you give him this, please?

I'll give it to him.

I'll just ask you from now on
not to come here anymore.

It's not right.

I'm sorry.

They say you became an actress.

You destroyed him.

Me?

You.

He loves me.

Loves?

Loves.

What does he understand about love?

Love. He ruined my life.

I can't stand him.

Interesting.

He not worthy of me.

I despise him.
I despise him and laugh at him.

I laugh at him.

Crazy girl.

You judge me.

Don't you?

Yes.

And you're right.

I'm just a loser!

You know, Pasha.

I'm a good worker still.

I'm hung in the hall of fame.

I mean, I'm hanging there.

I have many friends.

I don't drink.

You don't believe me?

I do believe you, Arkasha.

I'm losing my hair.

Where? Show me.

I'm getting old.

What are you saying, Arkasha!

You're the most handsome man.

It's impossible not to fall in love with you.

Isn't there anyone better
in your new world of cinema?

No.

Somewhere else then?

There isn't anyone.

Well I don't know.

Just calm down.

Calm down, Arkasha.

Everything's gonna be fine at home.

Calm down.

Well I wasn't speaking about it.

You were, Arkasha.

You were.

She probably loves you very much.

Just...just calm down!

And what about you?

Don't, Arkasha.
Don't think about me.

Everything's fine with me.

You know how strong I am.

Don't think about me.

Go, Arkasha.

You...

Just don't think.

Give me a cross!

Give me a cross!

A cross!

Comrades, it's the last reel.
Get ready!

When the light is turned on,
you'll all go into the screen.

Good.

- The audience loves it!
- And what do you think?

Superb.
I haven't seen anything better.

I see.

Time, comrades! Let's go!

To hell with it!

- So Pasha!
- Let's go!

Why are you trembling?

I'm not trembling, I'm shaking. 
So am I.

Thank you.
