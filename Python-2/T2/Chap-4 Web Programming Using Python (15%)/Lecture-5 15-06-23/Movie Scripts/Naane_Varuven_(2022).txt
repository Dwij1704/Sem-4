Once upon a time,
there lived two kings.
One of the kings was good.
And the other king...
Answer me!
I know which of you did it.
Prabhu?
Kathir?
Speak up, or I'll tell your father
both of you did it together.
You do know what'd happen
if Dad found out?
Mum, please.
Don't tell Dad.
Even if I don't,
the neighbour will.
Why won't you let me
live in peace?






You beat up the neighbour's kid so badly!
What if something bad had happened?
I will not hide it this time.
You will learn
only if you're thrashed.
Why would you do such a thing?
Say sorry.
Tell them you're sorry.
And that you won't repeat it.
Will you apologise, or not?
Kathir, if you don't apologise,
I will kill you!
Say sorry. Say sorry.
Say sorry.
- Dear, please don't.
- Out of my way. Say sorry.
- Say sorry. Say sorry.
- Please don't...
Dammit!
You're done for.
He won't even open his mouth!
- You mongrel!
- Dear, please don't...






He was born along with you.
Can't you learn from him?
- No more food or water for you.
- Dear, don't...
You're incorrigible.
You stay right here and die.
It will grow dark in a while.
Ghosts and spirits will come soon.
You're only fit for their company.
Poor boy!
Please bring him inside.
He's a child.
He'd get scared.
You don't get it, dear.
There's something seriously wrong with him.
Everyone says we should put him
in a mental hospital.
We must have committed a grave sin
in a past life, to have birthed such a son.
Let me say this...
I am scared that he will be
a bad influence on Prabhu as well.
Fine, go now.
To hell with it.
Untie him, and bring him in.
Kathir!
Kathir!
Kathir!
Kathir!
Kathir!
The pleasure of hunting
is something else.
But rather than kill an innocent creature
with only five senses...
to kill a human with six senses
is both meaningful and pleasurable.
Normally, I don't let anybody live
for this long.
I don't know why,
I really like you.
Something about your eyes.
I wish I don't have to kill you.
Run!
Didn't I tell you?
You're more dangerous than me.
Go on, do it!
Where's my husband?
We've informed him.
He'll be here any minute.
I'll not have the baby
if Prabhu is not here.
How are you feeling?
Sorry, dear.
I tried but I couldn't make it on time.
I had an important meeting.
Fine, then.
I was thinking we could name her
Sathya, like you wished.
Let's name her Kokila Rani
like I wanted, then.
What say? Shall we?
Sathya!

Sathya!
Sathya...
Be careful, girl.
Careful.
Carefu...
What's wrong?
Sathya? Sathya?
What's wrong?
- Sathya!
- Mom!
Mom, something's... not right.
What is it?
Sathya!
Sathya?
There's something wrong with this place.
Let's get out of here.
Sathya, careful!
Watch your step.
Slowly...
Don't be afraid, Sathya.
Why are you looking at me
like that, Guna?
I am jealous of you, sir.
Why?
How could one man have it all?
Don't jinx it!
I try not to, but it's hard.
A wife who understands you,
an angel of a child...
Of course I'm jealous.
How was your vacation?
It was beautiful.
- But Sathya has been unwell
ever since we returned. - Oh, no.
She's getting better.
Will you please check these
remaining files?
Sathya won't eat unless
I am there.
Good night.
She goes to sleep late,
and struggles to wake up for school.
What happened, Bhuvana?
What are you thinking about?
It's just...
The little one is twelve.
She'll become a big girl soon.
Then she'll go to college,
get married... go away from us.
We'll be all alone then.
If you wish, we can not let her get married
and keep her with us.
What, then?
It has to happen.
There's two of us.
Where's the question of being alone?
We should have another baby.
Bhuvana...
We've been through this.
I don't want another child.
In this life, we'll only have one child.
And that's Sathya.
I don't want to share my love
for Sathya with anybody.
Okay?
Let's not talk about this again.
Sathya...
What happened, kiddo?
Dadda...
What?
What happened?
Did you have a nightmare?
What happened, silly girl?
Fine, I won't call her that.
What happened, madam?
Can I tell you something?
What do you want to tell me?
Tell me.
No.
Can I sleep here tonight?
Oh, no way.
You're not a child anymore.
You're all grown up.
How will we fit?
I'll roll over and fall down.
You roll over and fall down, then.
We're sleeping here.
Leave my glasses there.
Let go!
You both do this all the time.
Father and daughter always chase me out.
I should have built a room for myself.
Dammit!
Dear!
Come here a minute.
I need to tell you something.
What is it?
It's getting late for school.
Please, come here.
- Two minutes, Sathya.
- Okay, Dad.
You had all morning.
Tell me, what is it?
- I slept in the little one's room yesterday...
- Yeah?
Something's not right.
Huh?
I felt someone pressing me down.
What do you mean?
I felt someone... pressing me down.
I tried to get up
but I couldn't.
I tried to move my hands and legs...
but couldn't.
It was so strange...
- ...my stomach was in knots.
- Fool!
Don't go talking that way
in front of the child.
Even I have such dreams sometimes.
Just pray to god, and lie down.
It will all be fine.
Sathya...
Yes, Dadda?
Is everything fine in your room?
I don't understand.
I mean...
Any sort of disturbance, or...?
Ye...
Dad...
Disturbance, Dadda?
Like what?
The colour of your walls?
The position of your bed?
Dadda, no problem.
- Hmmm?
- Hmmm.
Okay.
I felt someone... pressing me down.
No...
They wouldn't believe me
if I told them now.
No, listen to me.
Please.
Sorry, sorry.
I will definitely tell them tomorrow.
No, I said I'll tell them.
Okay, okay...
Who were you talking to, kiddo?
Nobody.
No?
Dadda heard your voice.
No.
I was playing, Dadda.
Fine, it's getting late.
You have school tomorrow. Sleep.
- Good night.
- Good night, Dada.
Please. Go.
No, I can't tell him now.
Fine, I will. Just wait.
Tomorrow, I promise.
Please listen to me...
Fine, I'll talk to him.
I will...
The tea is getting cold...
Sir...
I couldn't help but notice,
for a while now...
you've appeared low.
You're always so happy and jolly.
I derive positivity from you.
What's wrong now?
Tell me.
Guna...
Do you talk alone?
What?
I mean...
Do you sit and talk
to yourself, alone?
When life is at its worst,
I talk when I'm alone.
After a couple of rounds.
Why?
No...
do you talk alone...
as if someone else is present?
If someone's present,
then it doesn't mean I'm alone?
Why are you so confused?
Look at me now.
Oh, really?
No, I've eaten.
- Oh, him? Guna has eaten too.
- Sir, sir...
What are you doing?
There's nobody there, right?
Is there somebody there?
No.
But you see how I'm talking
as though someone's there?
Why are you scaring me?
My daughter...
talks when she's alone...
as though someone's there, Guna.
What are you saying?
Please take her to a doctor immediately.
- Hello?
- Hello, Bhuvana?
- How are you?
- I'm good.
- What's the matter, ma'am?
- Could you please drop by at the school?
What happened?
Is Sathya okay?
Yes, she's okay.
But it would be great if you could come.
For a while now,
Sathya appears low.
She's not talking to anybody.
She's normally a happy,
active child.
But now she looks drowsy in class.
Many of her teachers have complained.
Is she not sleeping well at home?
No, ma'am.
She goes to sleep on time.
Even her grades are poor.
I'd suggest you look into this.
Why are her grades so poor?
That's what her teacher said, too.
Apparently her behaviour
has really changed too.
Try talking to her.
She only shares everything with you.
She never talks to me.
Why are you getting so worked up?
Wait, I'll talk to her.
Please... Leave.
I cannot tell him now.
Fine, fine I'll tell him.
I promise I'll tell him.
I...
I'm scared. Please leave.
Okay, okay.
Leave me alone, please.
What are you looking for?
We had a baby monitor
when Sathya was a baby. Where is it?
You're always watching that rubbish
'My Little Pony' show.
Give me the remote.
I want to watch the news.
Mom, please!
It's the last episode.
How much longer?
Just one hour, Mom.
- You better give me the remote in an hour.
- I promise, Mom.
Let me watch it in peace now.
Why are you saying this now?
I promise, I didn't say anything.
Please believe me.
No, I didn't do anything.
My dadda...
My dadda has set it up for me.
- Okay!
- What happened?
No, no.
Please!
I'll throw it...
I'm throwing it!
Dear!
What is going on?
Let's go in there and check.
What's happening?
Why are you saying that?
I promise, I didn't say anything.
Please believe me.
No, I didn't do anything.
My dadda...
he left it here for me.
Sathya...
You know you can
tell Dadda anything, right?
I can tell you've got a problem.
Won't you tell Dadda about it?
There's nothing, Dadda.
Are you lying to Dadda?
Do you want to talk to
your mother about it?
No...
Grandma or Grandpa?
No...
Who do you want to talk to then?
A psychiatrist.
Okay.
I'm not taking you to school today.
I'll take you to a psychiatrist but...
...let's not tell Mom about it, okay?
- Hmmm?
- Hmmm.
Okay.
Sathya...
do you want your father around,
or shall I send him out?
Anything is okay, kiddo.
Let Dad be here.
Okay.
Now tell me.
What's bothering you?
I have a friend.
Okay...
His name is Sonu.
He's not letting me sleep.
He keeps ordering me around
to do things.
Who is this Sonu?
It's okay, Sathya...
Doctor, I'm not a fool, okay?
At first, I thought he was real.
But in a few days, I realised that he
wasn't visible to anyone's eyes but mine.
Please don't cry.
It's very normal for children to
develop an imaginary friend.
- It's not a big deal...
- You don't understand.
He tells me things.
What does he tell you?
He...
What is it?
What does he tell you?
He's threatening to kill my father
if I speak any more.
Threatening you?
Is he here now?
Is he?
Where?
Behind you.
I know.
There's no one there.
Correct?
It's okay, dear.
This is very normal.
There's nothing wrong with you.
I'm going to take care of you.
Just a few medicines.
Then you'll be perfectly fine.
Hmmm?
Sir...
she's my whole life.
If something were to happen to her..
I will die.
Why are you getting worked up?
It will be fine.
I'll handle it.
Don't worry.
What happened?
Sathya...
She fell asleep on the way back,
in the car.
Did I wake you?
Are you going?
No.
Dadda's going to sleep right here,
next to you. Okay?
The next time your imaginary friend comes,
you call Dadda.
I won't let anything happen to you, okay?
Don't worry.
I love you, Dadda.
Everything looks normal.
Hey, let's play hide-and-seek?
One... two...
three... four...
five...
six... seven...
eight...
nine...
Kathir! Kathir!
Kathir!
Kathir! Open it, please...
Kathir...
Where's Prabhu?
He's inside.
Prabhu?
Prabhu!
Where is Prabhu?
Where is Prabhu?
They broke in, killed the boy's father and
stole the jewellery.
The boy fainted seeing it.
These things have become so common now.
Poor things!
I don't know whether
you will believe what I'm about to say.
These two lives cannot co-exist.
One of them is destined
to take the other's life.
Keep them apart, and do that
before it's too late.
Mom, Kathir is not coming?
Mom! Kathir hasn't come?
Mom, he's still there.
Sathya?
Sathya?
Sathya...
Sathya...
- just get down... slowly. Please.
- Dadda...
Dadda, he's making me do all this.
He's making me.
Sonu.
It's okay...
It's okay...
I'm here now.
Don't worry about anything, okay?
Where is Sonu?
Next to me.
Sathya...
Tell him you'll do whatever he says.
Okay?
Dadda!
Okay...
Dadda, he wants me to tell you...
What?
He says...
Dad, he says he'll kill you
if I don't say it.
Sathya...
he's not real, okay?
We're seeing a doctor now.
Everything will be alright soon.
Just trust me, okay?
He's saying he's real.
He's not real.
He's getting angry, Dadda!
He says he can prove that he's real.
How?
No, Dadda. He wants me to
say just one word to you.
What word?
Kathir.
What else does he say?
What?
He's gone.
Do you really believe that
it's a spirit?
- Yes, Guna.
- How?
I don't know, but I do.
What happened next?
It's been a quiet few days.
Maybe it left?
I don't think so, Guna.
What will you do now?
We have to contact it.
What do you mean, "contact it"?
It's not your cousin.
It's a spirit!
Don't risk it.
No, Guna.
I have done a lot of research
and found a crew of youngsters.
They're experts at contacting
supernatural beings.
They're coming tomorrow.
Sir, don't get me wrong.
If it's gone, just let it go.
Don't play around in these matters.
No, Guna.
You don't get it.
They walk in here and
call me "dude" and "bro".
Thanks, Aunty.
Thanks, Aunty.
- Such a weird bunch.
- Thanks, Aunty.
Thanks, Aunty.
She looks like a demon herself.
Sir, are you seriously going to
use these people?
They look like someone's cursed them.
I don't get you at all.
No, Guna. I've asked around.
They are experts.
- Kid...
- Uncle?
- What grade are you in?
- College, final year.
College final year?
Don't play with your daughter's life
with these kids.
Don't judge us based on
our appearance.
Right.
Whatever you say.
Face like a broken penny!
Dear...
- Tell me...
- Dear, I'm scared.
This is no playing matter.
Let's get a well-known godman
from my village to ward off the evil.
Everything will be fine then.
No, please trust me.
I know what I'm doing.
They've being handling such cases
scientifically, and have become a sensation.
Voice checking 1, 2, 3.
Checking for EMF.
Sara, can you hear me?
- Kid...
- Uncle?
Are you crazy?
Why are you feeling up the wall?
I'm marking my fingerprint
and checking it with the UV light.
Oh!
Why are you saying that?
I didn't say anything.
Please believe me.
I've heard it many times.
That keeps repeating.
Ah, cool.
Play.
Stop!
Play again.
- Hey, did you hear that?
- Yeah, got it bro.
Here we go!
Play.
Oh my god, this is for real bro!
What the hell?
Uncle, listen! Listen, Uncle!
My God!
Why would you say that?
I promise I didn't say anything.
Throw away the baby monitor.
No, please.
He's spying on you.
Dadda kept it here for me.
Throw it away, or I'll kill him.
I'll throw it away!
Dadda...
I find all this scary.
It's alright, kiddo.
Dadda's here for you.
Didn't I save you in the terrace
the other day?
So, even if we get to
the end of this world...
I'll still be there to protect you.
Dadda...
What should I do?
Nothing.
Just sleep.
- Okay?
- Okay, Dadda.
What should we do?
Nothing, you go chill.
Just rest.
We'll take care of everything.
But...
The child is alone.
Maybe I...
Uncle, don't worry.
That's what we're here for.
You go and rest.
- Uncle doesn't seem to get
our power. - Okay...
Code Red! Code Red!
Sathya is missing...
- Guys, please come here.
- What happened?
- She's not in her room.
- How can we lose her?
- This is the room?
- Can't see her anywhere.
- Sathya is gone?
- Replay the footage.
Anything on the thermal cam?
Spotted Sathya! But there's no audio.
No audio! Check the mic.
Everything is technically correct.
- Immanuel, I need audio and camera now.
- Let me check the cables.
Check the pre-amps.
- What is happening?
- Shush. Wait.
Jesus Christ!
She's trying to say something.
Help.
- What happened?
- The power went out!
- Turn on the back-up, man.
- What the hell happened?
Switch the power source.
There she is! Go to her room.
Go, go, go.
Hurry!
- What happened?
- Sathya!
- Sathya!
- What the hell happened?
Uncle, don't go in there.
Stop... stop...
Oh, God...
Where is this going, man?
Uncle, don't go!
Why is it going back into the room?
Dadda!
Uncle, don't go in there!
Just wait for a bit.
No! Sathya!
No!
Sathya! Sathya!
Sathya! No! No!
Sathya! Sathya!
Somebody help me!
I told you! I told you!
I told you! I told you!
I told you! I told you!
I told you! I told you!
I told you! I told you!
Move, move!
Sathya...
I was waiting for this.
Sara, translate...
Working on it.
"This is what I was waiting for."
Who...
Whoever you are...
please leave my daughter.
It's in your hands.
It's in your hands...
I'll do anything.
Anything you ask me.
Not much. Just a murder.
Not much. Just a murder.
Who do you...
Who do you want me to kill?
Your brother.
Kathir.
Mr. Prabhu...
I am not just a psychiatrist.
I am also a spiritual healer.
I believe in good and bad energy.
You may wonder how
a doctor could say such things.
I sense some energy in Sathya
for some reason.
But a possession is a possession.
There are three stages in a possession.
First, she realises that it is around her.
Then, it will use her power
to control her mental state.
Finally, it will spread through her body
and suck the life out of her.
She will feel no hunger.
No medication will work on her.
If we don't act fast...
her life...
Look, to be frank...
she's running against time.
Such cases...
are handled by some
through godmen and prayers.
Some others try exorcism.
But in my opinion,
the most effective and successful is...
to do what it desires,
if it can be done.
I don't know what it desires,
but we should find out.
And do it as soon as possible.
Dadda...
On November 17th, at 2PM...
Sonu says you must open this video,
and has asked me to set a reminder.
He says he wishes to communicate
some things with you.
He says, I will tell you who I am,
and my story.
My name is Sonu.
I lived with my brother Manu,
my mother Madhuri, and my father Kathir...
we were a beautiful, happy family.
My mother looks like an angel.
But she couldn't speak.
My father looks just like you.
I am very fond of my father.
He is crazy about us, too.
My father always plays with us.

Don't be afraid, son.
- No, Dad! No, no.
- It will be as scared as you are.
Okay, Dad.
Let him go, Dad. You know he's scared.
Who's that, Dad?
It was crazy!
- Next time, teach me also?
- Yeah, yeah I love it.
Hey, look at him.
- Hi, bro.
- Let's take a selfie.
Me first!
- Look at them.
- He's so handsome, man.
I'm impressed.
You get in.
Smile! Look at the phone.
- Say 'cheese'.
- No pictures, please.
Oh, the security guard can speak English?
No? No?
No selfies?
- Just take one?
- Why?
- So much attitude.
- He's putting up a price.
This is a private property.
And you're tresp...
Now he'll agree.
Darling, just a couple of selfies.
Please?
The children are getting scared.
Please leave.
Oh really?
You have pot?
Marijuana.
You know, ganja.
No. Leave.
Come on, man.
I know you have it.
Leave.
Take this, and give it to me.
Take it, and give me.
Let's go.
Answer me when I talk to you, mongrel.
Come back.
Hit him.
- Come on!
- Hit him.
- He's got an attitude problem!
- Chill out, man. Let him go.
Why are they behaving this way, Dad?
They're behaving that way
because they're drunk.
- Boys, what are you talking?
- No.
Huh?
- Tell me, what is it?
- Dad...
- Let me go, I'll tell you.
- Fine, tell me.
Rearing cattle all the time
has made you a scared cow.
You brat!
Yeah, you should have
whacked them.
My brother and I had our own
secret language.
Only the two of us speak it.
Dad, dad, dad, dad...
let me come with you, Dad?
Please, Dad?
No, it's not safe.
Would I hunt, or watch over you?
Too risky.
What could happen to me
when you're there?
I've begged you so many times.
You always say 'no'. Please, Dad!
Take me today, at least.
You'd get scared.
I won't get scared, Dad.
Please!
Boo!
You said you won't get scared?
Buzz off.
I'm going to document my father hunting.
It's going to be a great adventure.
He's a scaredy cat.
I have to look after him all the time.
Now I am following my Dad.
Please forgive us, sir.
Give us one chance, sir.
Please spare us, sir.
Sir, we'll never come back.
Run!
RUN!

Look...
You won't understand this.
I don't expect you to understand it.
What you just saw...
if you tell your brother
or your mother about it...
you saw what happened
to those three?
The same thing will happen
to the three of you.
Understand?
What happened?
Why would you take him?
Why would I take him?
He got into the jeep
without my knowledge.
See.
He got scared watching me hunt.
Who asked you to go there? Get in.
Now you get it?
This is why I never go.
Good boy.
Come.
Carry on, I'll do it.
Eat up!
Eat!

♪ ...will never let you go ♪

- Bye, Dad!
- Bye!
Bye!
Madhuri, I think he's running a fever.
Take a look at it.
He told you?
So he told you?
So he told you.
No?
Sit.
Sit.
Why are you getting scared?
What's happened now?
Have I ever hit you?
Or you? You? You?
I have so much...
So much love for you!
Yeah, Manu?
Sonu? Come on!
Everything's changed?
At an early age, I'd seen it all.
I've been an orphan all my life.
I had to become this person
to live, to survive, to eat.
And then I met you.
The fact that even I have a wife, a family,
and children...
I can't believe it myself, sometimes.
I love you more than life itself.
But...
a demon lives inside me.
You have nothing to do with him.
If anything changes...
if anything goes wrong...
Please let us go.
We'll go away somewhere.
Where would you go?
Please don't do that, Madhuri.
You say you'll leave me, Madhuri...
I've got no one but you.
You'd take my children away from me?
Will my happiness never be permanent?
I will dance. I will sing.
I will celebrate.

After that, he kept the three of us
tied up all the time.
He took our phones and broke them.
We couldn't even ask anybody for help.
Eat.
Somehow, I'm not in the mood
to drink tonight.
We'll dance!
Everything will be fine
in a few days.
You'll get used to it.
Okay?
Do you think this gives me any pleasure?
Keeping all of you tied up?
Because of you,
I had to tie up Sonu and Manu too.
Sit.
Now I feel like drinking.
Mom, what happened?
Why isn't the boat moving?
Mom!
Mom!
Mom, do something.
Mom, do something.
Please.
Mom, do something.
Please.
Mom, I'm scared!
Mom...
Mom, do something...
Mom, save me.
I am scared.
Come.
Mom...
Let's go.
- Please, let us go.
- Mom! Mom!
Listen to me. Let's go.
Mom!
Listen to me. I'm feeling dizzy.
I don't understand what's going on.
Let's just go.
Sonu, stop it.
Mom!
Sonu...
Mom!
Mom!
Mom! Mom! Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Sonu!
Sonu...
Sonu...
Sonu...
Sonu...
Sonu...
You're all I have now, son.
If only I hadn't sneaked into the jeep
that night, my mother would be alive now.
Now all I want is to save my brother.
When you see this video,
I'll be in Sathya's body.
I'll have taken over
all her energy.
Nothing can change that.
Only if you kill my father
can I leave Sathya's body.
And if this doesn't happen...
you cannot save Sathya.
I have sedated her.
It's a long flight. Let her sleep well.
- Don't worry, everything will be fine.
- Okay, sir.
Please think about this.
Let me come with you.
No.
I'll bring her back to you
as our Sathya.
You needn't come.
You know what I'm going for.
I won't allow you to come with me.
Stop the car!
Please, stop!
- Sathya!
- Be careful!
- Careful.
- Relax, Sathya.
- Get down...
- Be careful.
Careful, careful...
Sathya!
Sathya, what happened?
I'm getting the injection.
Doctor, please help.
Please help...
Oh, no!
- Please move aside.
- Doctor, please help.
Sathya!
It's going to be okay...
Sathya!
Sathya!
Sathya!
Guna, please get some water.
Sathya!
Sathya, look at me.
Relax, relax...
You're okay.
She's fine.
It's okay...
Sathya must eat.
Make her eat somehow.
You could give her glucose instead?
Am I right?
Doctor, if you need help,
I'm up for it.
What do you even know?
What? I'm a supervisor.
I supervise stuff.
What do you know about medicine?
No big deal.
Crocin for fever.
And if that doesn't work,
rum and pepper totally works.
Can I ask you something?
Ask.
Why did you come with us?
Why are you being rude, sir?
I came here to show him support.
I could ask you the same.
Such bad energy out here.
Sir... sir... sir!
Sathya...
Please eat a little?
For me?
Sonu?
Sonu...
Sonu, please...
I beg you.
Please allow my daughter to eat.
Sonu...
Didn't you like being fed by your mother?
Let my daughter...
What is it?
Nothing.
Tell me.
Sonu...
I thought... Sonu had come.
I can feel his presence.
I felt like he called out to me, Dad.
I understand.
It's a twin thing.
I'll tell you something?
I had a twin too.
I can feel my twin's presence too.
Suddenly.
After all these years.
Maybe...
my little brother is in town?
Anyway, go to bed.
You have school tomorrow.
I think school's over.
Are you sure it's this school?
Sathy...
Sonu...
Oh, so you chat with the spirit now?
We're waiting for the boy...
but what if he doesn't turn up?
We must convince him somehow
and take him with us.
Manu...
Guna, look over there.
That's the boy.
Please tell him the truth
and bring him over somehow.
No, I'm scared.
- Please, Guna. Don't waste time.
- No, sir...
- Please go, Guna...
- Sir!
Stop, kid.
Your name is Manu?
What?
Tell me!
Your brother Sonu asked me to fetch you.
Come.
Your brother has returned as a spirit
and ruining our lives.
I swear.
Look at the girl over there.
Manu...
Your brother has possessed the girl.
Don't cry, kid.
They'll thrash me if I don't kidnap you.
What did you tell him?
The truth.
You fool!
Where's Sathya?
Sathya? Sathya!
Where did she go? Sir!
Manu!
Stop! Wait...
I know Sonu is gone.
I know Sonu is gone.
Manu, I've come to kill Dad.
I've come to kill our father. To avenge Mom.
I've come to save you,
and put an end to everything.
Sathya!
Sathya! Sathya!
We're running out of time.
Sir...
are you seriously going to kill?
To save my daughter, I'll kill not one,
but even ten people.
Uncle...
How do you look just like my father?
Sonu told me he'd send you here.
What's the plan?
Your father...
your father...
I'm going to kill him.
No way you can.
Do you even know who my father is?
Come with me.
Look, I must kill your father.
Only then can I save my daughter.
What?
For which, you need to be alive
I said.
Let go, kid.
The very thought of your father
scares me too.
But I must save you.
And my daughter.
I have to do this.
What are you doing here?
Who is this?
Hey...
Prabhu!
Wow!
I can't believe this, man.
Twin instinct, eh?
Are you well?
How did you get here?
Look...
Let us go.
Manu and I will get out of here.
Manu?
- How do you know...?
- It wasn't me, Dad!
I don't know anything.
What's this?
Is this some uncle instinct,
like twin instinct?
Listen up, Uncle...
You're free to leave.
How can you ask to take Manu?
I don't get it.
What do you plan to do with him?
You'll kill him too, just like
you killed our father, your wife and son.
I know all about it.
Let us go.
We'll walk away from here.
You can get out of here too.
We won't go to the police.
I'm not supposed to have anything
good in life?
I've felt nothing for you,
ever since we were kids.
I still don't.
Manu!
Manu!
Uncle, no.
Don't go that way!
What now?
You're going to fight?
How cool!
Dad, please don't.
No!
You can't do a thing to me.
Know why?
There's a lot of pain in me.
The pain of loneliness.
The pain of hunger.
The pain of begging.
The pain of darkness.
The pain of being abandoned
by my mother.
What do you have that I don't?
A knife.
Sathya!
Go away!
Go away!
Go away, Sathya!
Your daughter?
Go, Sathya!
What are you looking at?
Can't recognise me?
Sathya... go!
This is not his daughter.
It's your son.
My brother.
Sonu.
Manu!
Don't shout.
Don't shout.
Manu!
Don't shout.
Manu, don't go that way.
You'll fall down the mountain.
Manu!
Stop shouting!
If you go that way,
I'll fall too!
I love you, Sathya.
Dadda will always be with you.
Manu!
Manu, let go.
Listen to me, Manu.
Manu!
Dadda!
Dadda!
Dadda!
Dadda!
Dadda!
Dadda!
Sathya!
Come with me.
Let's go home.
When you managed to survive...
my dad must have survived too?
My dad always spoke about twin instinct.
Aren't you his twin?
What do you feel?
Is he alive?
Or is he dead?
