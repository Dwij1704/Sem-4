This is our life, to remove
poison from the snake...
and make a living like that.
This is the job of
snake charmers.
We live amongst the mountains.
In difficult conditions.
We can face any kind of
wild animals...
We always tame the snakes
under control.
Beyond this jungle there
is huge snake that lives.
The poison of that snake is
slowly spreading.
This must be the custom in the
city, but not in the jungles.






If Nagi's valued the importance
of the customs...
then this age old friendship
wouldn't have turned to enmity.
Its been ten years since
the fair of spring season...
they conned us and bought
all our poison for peanuts.
This was a deal of
friendship and enmity.
Of the relationships,
of love and affection.
Since that day our
relation broke.
We were poor so could not
snap business relations.
And after 10 years...
again there is a fair
and also the time for revenge.
This is our decision that,
this time during the fair...
We will reap the benefit
of our own hard work.
The Nagi tribe will not get
a drop of poison from us.
Do you all agree to my decision?






- Its bad .The news will be out.
- Let it be.
I also want that to happen.
With out any reason,
or any crime...
today they have challenged us.
The custom of the jungle
is friendship to friends...
and enmity to enemies.
Today we swear on the arrow
of the Ragis...
which is pinching
every Nagi in Nagi tribe.
And this is the leader's
pledge...
That today the bloodshed
caused by them...
will be avenged by us.
You don't have to fight
when I'm there...
I'm you son as well
as your daughter.
The enemy will be my target.
Yes father I will get
his head on to your feet.
- Who is he? - Sanatan.
- Sanatan.
This is the message of
death for Sanatan.
Father please bless me.
Tomorrow early in the
morning the tribe's...
children, men women
of all ages...
will come along with
me in the jungle.
And this Sanatan will be
caught by me personally.
Reena, why is
Mala so quite today?
She is worried as she has
to catch the Sanatan today.
So what if he is dangerous.
He cannot escape from me.
Don't be so overconfident.
His name is Sanatan.
My name is also Mala, meaning
a chain which can...
squeeze anybody's neck.
- Is everything ready?
- Yes sir.
Where has Sanatan gone?
- He has gone ahead.
- Then lets all go.
Come on play the instrument
so that all snakes come.
Sanatan!! lts our defeat. Where
is the magic of your instrument?
"My mind swinging and
so is my body."
"My heart has lost its peace."
"Who is this, who is
playing the flute."
"In my sweet dreams I saw."
"I saw a new life for my self."
"I have left all my inhibitions."
"And God knows where I'm
moving towards alone."
"No one knows where
I'm moving towards alone."
"The tune is so
euphoric as if..."
"As if the spring
season is on."
"Who is the one, who
is playing the instrument."
"My mind is swinging,
and so is the body."
"Who has spread this
golden colour..."
"On every step?
"To tantalize my mind."
"God knows who is this
person with the flute."
"My feet are swinging
so is my mind saying."
"That your heart has
become a captive."
"Who is this who is
playing the flute."
Who are you?
Mala.
Mala?
The euphoric she snake
in the form of a woman?
- And your name?
- Sanatan.
The one responsible for the bloodshed
in Nagi Tribe? Get ready to die!!
One more.
Don't leave, life long.
And Nagi's fearlessly
avenge the enemies.
And we have the strength to
turn the enmity into love.
Love and with you?
Never!!
Very good son.
Shame on the Ragi's.
The Ragi's leader
Say something, why are you mum?
You had come in the jungle
to catch the snakes.
Now what have you got?
Ha!?
In the fair of the
spring season...
this sarcastic
laugh of yours will not remain.
Such kind of hatred that
you forgot the custom of jungle?
Never strike a person who
is sleeping.
Never mind, as it is we
have forgiven...
you people several times.
So once more.
Come on I will leave you
to the other side.
No need I can go alone.
Don't be too proud of
your beauty...
This is a jungle and this
a creepy night.
At least think of your
own delicate self?
Don't you dare follow me.
At the moment you are in
our jurisdiction...
and our guest too.
No one should complain that
we took advantage of you.
Sit there.
Dare you move!!
Don't forget that, the magic of
my flute has made you entranced.
Will you take it?
This? Don't play it.
If I don't, then won't you
get away from me?
Sanatan, please stop it.
You came to hunt for me
but, became a captive yourself.
Sanatan you please go back.
- And if I wish to stay?
- You don't know that...
your life is at danger out here.
Life? life is in danger
since the time...
you came into my life.
This is not the time for being
poetic, please go back.
Where?
Will you leave me like this?
You don't know Sanatan
this bank of the river...
has become a strange
place for me too.
What is this?
I had taken a pledge to take your life
with this arrow.
And, only this arrow remains.
You don't know what has
made me your captive.
When will you come again?
Ask me, when will I not.
This flute is the voice
from my heart...
as soon as you hear it
come running.
Sir!! Sir
There is a good news.
- Mala is alive.
- Alive!!
I saw her with my eyes.
Why did you not die?
Why did come here alive?
Where were you?
Tell me?
Father!!
Father!!
To hell with your father.
Tell me where were you?
I searched you everywhere. You
were not in our jurisdiction.
You were in the enemies
territory tell me?
Who was with you?
Please listen to me.
- Get up!!
- I was on the other side.
But you don't know how much...
What happened to you?
When I got separated
from the rest of the tribe...
in front of me there was
a huge snake.
- Really?
- Yes father...
he first stared at me
and then I stared at it...
Then who saved you?
By God's grace,
and your blessings.
Your daughter won.
Child!!
After all you are my daughter.
Please forgive me.
Hey! where are you taking this?
We are not thieves, but
businessmen.
We all have collected items
from all over to sell.
We were collecting items to
sell in the carnival of spring.
- Sir this looks very nice.
- Is it so?
- But it is very expensive.
- Expensive?
This is so beautiful.
Hey old man,
What are you selling?
He is selling some sweet.
You want to buy?
What beauty, oh beautiful you
are sweet as a rose yourself.
Listen what is your name?
My name?
A rat.
So beautiful.
I'm a millipede. 'Kaan Khajura'
Give her the most
beautiful bangles...
From my side.
If you dare, do it yourself.
You want to see what I dare?
Don't be mistaken I'm
the leader's daughter.
You are beautiful as
well as very brave.
This Ragi won against us
in the fair full of people.
They are full of poison and
we have nothing.
What do you want me to do?
Okay understood,
Wow! a beauty.
- Is she your daughter?
- Yes of course.
She is very beautiful.
Leave it, first you tell me
whether you will help me or not?
Do you remember...
My father talked about my
marriage to your daughter?
- Of course I remember.
- Then, shouldn't I help?
Will you reward me handsomely
after I help?
Of course I promise.
Then go and relax, we
meet in the carnival of spring.
Oh... she's
oblivious to the world.
Who told you to go across to
the other side of the jungle?
You run towards the other
side when you are in trouble.
Look at her
she is in a dream world.
Then let her go, she is lovesick.
Such times the pain of love
is only the medicine.
Lets some how call the man with
a magical flute.
The way she got mesmerized, with
the same tune she will be back.
"Listen to me my friends
my sweetheart is calling me."
"I want to go to my
sweethearts abode."
"I want to go my
sweethearts abode."
"I will choose the choicest
of the flowers from the garden."
"I will decorate my room
with all beautiful buds."
"I will bedeck myself
with adornments."
"Please make my veil colorful."
"I want to go to my
sweetheart's abode"
"Listen to me, friends.
My sweetheart is calling."
"My sweetheart is enticing
me with his magical tune."
"Give me my anklets to put on."
"Adorn me, without any delay,"
"or else my sweetheart
might get annoyed."
"I want to go to my
sweetheart's abode."
"Listen to me my friends,
my sweet heart is calling me"
"I have to go to my
sweethearts abode."
It seems years
have passed between...
between yesterday and tonight.
Where are we?
Where there is a horizon.
Where the light disappears
into the depth of darkness.
The serene, most peaceful and
away from everybody.
The highest point in the world.
- Where only you are there.
- And you are there.
- I'm there.
- And?
And our love.
"My diviner sweetheart
please leave my hand."
"It is already midnight,
let me go back home."
"Let me go my sweetheart..."
"Oh my darling."
"My town is very far away."
"I can't wait here any longer."
"My love is very helpless."
"I'm bound by an
invisible chain."
"Let me go back home."
"My diviner sweetheart
leave my hand."
"My guilty eyes will..."
"Be noticed by my friends."
"They will tease
me, with your name."
"And so don't stop
me my sweetheart..."
"Take my word to meet
tomorrow evening."
"We will again be together
tomorrow."
"Let me go back home."
Did you hear?
My heart is pounding.
This will always happen
please don't lose heart.
We will meet in the
fair of the spring season.
How will I know that you
are go back safe?
When you hear the tune of my
flute, assume that I'm alive.
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing... nothing father.
Who was here right now?
No one.
Remember that if you malign my
name then I will skin you alive.
Come on lets go.
I'll see where he
escapes from me.
You came very late.
Why any thing important?
Did you forget your promise?
Promise,
I don't deter from my word.
And my vow is indelible, chief...
my friends are your friends...
and your enemies can be
my enemies.
These hand full of
Nagi's will be come paupers...
and will be completely ruined.
- But...
- But what?...But what?
- But my reward?
- I have told you.
- You will get whatever you ask.
- Chief...
- I asking you right now.
- I'm not going to get deterred.
You get along your promise.
And when time comes...
I will keep my promise.
Go my child.
Oh God are you
going to ruin the drama?
- Where are you?
- We both are here.
- Who are you?
- I... Munni.
Then get ready fast.
All have come.
Come on... hurry.
Sit here... Hurry up.
"Leave it sweetheart
leave my kite ."
"No I will not leave it,
first let our eyes meet."
"The yarn is coloured
with the colour of love."
"And the kite has come to
your locality stealthily."
"The world says..."
"leave the yarn of my kite."
"No I will not leave it,
"first let our eyes meet."
"The world is waiting to see
the, dreams getting unraveled"
"In the highs of the blue
sky let my kite fly."
"A young nubile dances
with euphoria."
"Enticingly she sings
the songs of love."
"Who has the fortitude
and the hold over it."
"Let the kite fly in my domain."
"I won't leave it
let our eyes meet first."
Mala. The chief.
Run!!
The time to sell poison has
started...
The people should come
come with their items to sell.
Mala I just be
back. They must be waiting.
When the poor fight for
their rights...
then the pangs of hunger
can get them united.
So what if you have closed
our one bazaar...
our capacity is to open
hundred such Bazaars'.
And we will travel all over
to sell our poison.
And we will follow you
like a shadow...
wherever you go to sell
We will sell it for free.
- Please buy my poison. I...
- How dare you!!
He is my man.
He is my descendant
He may be so
but this is an open market...
everyone here has a free
right to sell and buy poison
You want to challenge me?
Challenge is always between
the two equals.
We are ruined.
Prabir has shed our
blood in the form of poison.
Chief did you see how
the enemies were defeated?
And now get me my reward,
Mala's hand in marriage.
Mala? Where is Mala?
By winning over a girl you've
destroyed livelihood of the poor.
Sanatan, an elephant
is after all an animal.
Not only the elephant but, even
the owner seems to be an animal.
Looks like your bad
days are here.
You are trying to fly high...
and probably at the
cost of your life.
- Lets see whose life's at stake.
- Have mercy on your youth.
- Go on! Don't mess with me.
- Do you only to fight verbally?
Come on the field.
Get aside!!
Fire!
Don't lose heart.
Please have patience Mala.
Whose dreams are shattered...
How can that person be
at peace. Mother!
Don't be disappointed.
God is always there.
Doesn't he know the
pain in your heart?
Definitely God will save you.
Mother!!
Now the situation
has become very serious.
Poor Mala.
We should do something.
I don't see any way out.
- Yes.
- What will you do?
You just go on watching
what I do.
Who's there!! What were you
doing tell me?
What?
Chief?
Chief's son Sanatan?
You were going to meet, Sanatan?
See Leela I promise you.
Next birth I will
marry only you.
Come I will drop to
the other side of the border.
- Six, - I bet for Seven
So here it is.
- So here is it.
- 50 bags of rice. Six.
So here, Now three sixes.
- Another 50 bags more.
- Agreed.
Another six.
Yes!!!
Careful chief, the more you lose
the more will be the dowry.
I know it you keep playing.
- Okay six what is the bait.
- 25 goats.
Okay.
Six Hey!!!
Do you agree to a defeat,
or still want to play?
- If you have guts come forward.
- Keep a little aside or else...
- You will be left with nothing.
- You go on.
- What do you bet on?
- On the 5.
What are you looking at chief
this is not my voice but...
the voice from the sky.
- What ever you say oh ascetic.
- Hey you ascetic...
This is not some ritual
in the temple...
but a gamble... gamble.
Tell me chief what is the bait?
Bet for a five.
What ever was the bet until
now the same again.
- A six.
- Five, come on.
You are great oh Ascetic.
Thank you. Please guide me more.
I don't encourage anyone
in the lure of money.
Please tell me, I will not
let you go empty handed.
If not anything at least
have a meal here.
Al right, for your happiness
I shall have a meal...
But I don't eat from
any one and every one's hands.
What you wish, it
shall be full filled.
- Do you have any daughter?
- Yes.
- Is she unmarried?
- She is unmarried my lord.
Then you can become my host.
If your daughter bathes in the
river as the moon sets in...
Then she feeds me then I can
have the food served by her.
And I will grant her a wish
that she wants.
So shall it be my lord.
He is a very renowned Ascetic
child, bow down to him.
Bless you.
Bless you.
Beautiful, very beautiful.
What beautiful features Chief...
You are very fortunate that
this beauty is born to you.
Yes I can predict that
it is written on her forehead...
That very soon in her life...
there is going a great
young man.
Yes Lord, you're great.
Now to make him happy you will
have to feed him with a meal.
Go and have a bath soon.
We have always heard
that when the devotees...
are in trouble, then
the God appears...
- Today I saw it myself.
- He is an acclaimed ascetic.
I have heard that In the
highs of Himalaya's he has...
meditated for 20 years
remaining unclothed.
- Is it?
- Yes surely must be so.
"I saw Benares, I saw Mathura."
"I saw all the pilgrims"
"No where did I find my
soul mate."
"So I came to your door step."
"On your door step there
is a hermit."
"Neither does he ask for
and silver or gold."
"Only asks for a glimpse
at you."
"On your doorstep there
is hermit."
'Come with all the determination
and resolution in the mind."
"With a yearn for your
glimpse in the eyes."
"With love in the heart."
"Is what this admirer asks for."
"I turned away from this
world, and left everything."
"Left my entire house."
"I hunted all over but
made you my Goddess."
"Please listen to the
voice of my heart."
"On your doorstep
there is hermit."
How long will you meet me in
this disguise?
Till the time you become mine.
This heart belongs to you
Sanatan.
But in front of the world we
can never be united.
Other than clandestine meeting
I have nothing in my hands.
I cannot even elope with you.
Our eloping will cause
bloodshed between the two clans.
We cannot make our life...
at the cost of others' life.
On the path of love there
is always difficult Mala.
As God has made us fall in love
so will he show us the path.
But by that time...
I will already be
married of to Prabir.
Don't say such a thing Mala.
Our love is above everything.
As soon as he heard
he came out in a jiffy.
Get lost from here
if you love your life
You lord hermit I'm
going to get engaged.
I'm not foolish enough
to raise my hand on you.
Chief!!! Chief!!
- Chief!
- What is it?
Why have you come here?
I was going to get engaged
But seeing me unarmed...
you son attacked me.
I don't spare him.
Sanatan, throw your weapon.
According to the custom we
are bound to let him pass.
You are worth sitting
at home wearing bangles.
You want to see what I dare?
Should I come and make your
bride wear the bangles?
Go bangle vendor go right now...
go and make Mala
wear the bangles.
I have taken a pledge to
make Mala wear the bangles.
If this pledge is broken
then you remember...
- here is your reward.
- Chief...
- Good, go on.
- Bangles for sale!
Bangles, green yellow
blue bangles.
Bangles for sale!
Who is it?
Child... life is ruled by what
is written in the destiny.
You are helpless, and so are we.
You will have to go
through the ceremony Mala.
Wear these bangles.
We know that this marriage
is not of two souls...
how can we let you
go bare handed.
When there's no happiness...
what's the use of this?
If you ever meet my Sanatan...
"Hiding the abode of love
in the bangles..."
"I sell all of them."
"Do keep in mind."
"The token of my
love do remember my dame."
"Do keep in mind."
"Keep some place..."
"This heart of this
this outsider"
"How beautiful are you
smooth wrists."
"Has come into
your hands Oh! outsider."
"The eyes are meeting
and its a nice feeling."
"Don't break my heart
or turn away from me."
"Once you take my heart.
Keep in your mind."
"This token of love
remember it my dame."
"I have got the pieces of my heart."
"You are unique in this world."
"Oh my sweetheart."
O bangle vendor"
"You keep it in your mind"
I was dreaming since long
to see you in wedding attire.
You hands would be full of
bangles...
And I will ask your
hand in marriage.
This marriage is so unique.
No music no pomp and show.
And yet the bride euphoric.
My bride I will
take you like a fairy.
Get aside,
Who was that bangle vendor?
I'll see how
he gets away from me.
Open the door,
Or I'll break the door.
Chief, let me deal with him.
He has insulted me.
- I will take revenge.
- Take him away.
Take me away but,
please leave him.
Hit him, beat him.
Beat him more!
Shambhu!
Father!!
Break his bones and throw him to the
other side of the border.
Let them know what is it like
to mess with Nagi's.
Chief!...Chief!
Please come out.
What is it so late in the night?
There has been an
great atrocity chief.
What has happened?
Why aren't you saying something?
Who raised his hand on my child?
- Who else, but Nagi Chief.
- What!! Nagi!!
How dare they touch him?
Get ready with all your weapons.
Today either they live or we.
You attacked my son, If you have
the guts, come in front of me.
This traitor still alive?
I had ordered you to
skin him alive.
No one dares to do that to him.
For Sanatan's one drop of blood
we will chop 100 Nagi's heads.
Don't forget that you are
in my jurisdiction.
If I wish none of you all
will be alive.
Only cowards give
such threatening calls.
If you have the guts face
me, I have been hurt.
Now the fight will be
between you and me.
Come on then!!
- Father!
- Today I will Kill him.
I'm to be blamed, If you want
to kill, kill me, beat me.
Now I understand,
I have got my answer.
My Young son's
blood that is wasted...
he was supposed to
get married to you.
Keep quiet!
How can I
keep quiet looking at the fire?
Before attacking my son why
did you not stop your daughter?
In spite of knowing everything
why were you so blind...
to the fact, that who
was actually to be blamed?
Sanatan was drawn towards
your side...
or was your daughter's beauty
attracting him towards her?
You couldn't keep your prestige.
You couldn't keep her in control.
And like cowards you
wounded my son?
Enough, no need to
say anything more.
I'm sorry for what happened...
but your son too
is not totally innocent.
He came to meet my daughter
stealthily.
Youth is always crazy.
Chief.
Neither you have control
over it nor I.
If you want to keep
up your prestige and...
wish that there should
be peace between the two tribes.
Then get her married off in the
city somewhere far away.
What if Sanatan follows
Mala there too?
It will not happen.
And I promise you that.
I will keep him in
control but, remember!
The news of the marriage
should not reach my son.
Marriage should be held here.
I'm full filling my promise of
giving Mala's hand in marriage...
Whether here or in the city
how does it matter?
I know it very well chief
you are getting scared of...
Ragi's threats. I ask you
Why are you scared of them?
I will get married here
with a great pomp and show...
Let me see who can stop me.
Why should you fight for it,
when that can be done peacefully.
You want Mala,
And you will get her.
But the marriage will be
held in the city itself.
You also are obstinate.
People will say...
that we got scared like
rats and ran away.
This blame too I can
take for Mala's sake.
Who's it, Sanatan!
Chief!
Where were you going?
Tell me!!
You know it very well father.
To meet Mala?
Idiot!
In spite of breaking your bones
you haven't learnt a lesson?
Till Mala doesn't get married
I will not allow you to move.
- Father!
- Put him inside.
Leave me.
I say leave me.
If he tries to escape
then you skin him alive.
The vow I've taken is more
important to me than his life.
What are you looking at me.
If you had some shame...
you would have blinded yourself.
Neither would these eyes have
met, and nor...
would we have to bow
down to our enemies.
I will bind you before
you try to escape.
"What should I do with
the reverie...
and the musings in your
absence, what should I do?"
"What should I do remaining...
"away from you
tell me what should I do?"
"The world seems very vacuous.."
"Now where should I go..."
"Just explain away this much."
"In this melancholic semblance
where are you, my love?"
"My heart beckons to you
come my love"
"The storm was so intense
that has ravaged my dreams."
"The beautiful happy
world of love."
"Has been ravaged."
"Give me your glimpse
before I perish."
"Oh my sweetheart
"Please give, me a
glimpse of you."
"In this pensive semblance
where are you."
"My heart beckons to you...
please come"
"Masquerading my face
my life is in sorrow."
"Before the life has begun
why has it ended."
"I'm taking away the
sorrow from your life."
"Just come for a moment."
"In this pensive semblance...
where are you, my love?"
"My heart is yearning
for you please come."
"The solace to my sorrows...
please come"
I wouldn't exist, if we were
not destined to unite...
then these turmoils
paths wouldn't lead you to me.
We will never part.
Sanatan...
Let me take Mala's charge...
Father, with great difficulty
your child has got life again.
Now you want to snatch
away that life again?
- What kind of a father are you?
- My child...
I'm helpless, and I have
given a promise to Mala's father.
Promise!..., at the cost of
your son's life?
For you your vow is more
important?
My child sometimes we have
to keep our emotions aside...
and take control of your self.
- Come on lets go.
- Don't snatch away my life.
I'm helpless my son.
If you snatch away Mala from me,
I will be forced to defy you.
You will defy your father?
This is not a father and son's
fight...
but pertaining to the
whole world father.
- Sanatan! Leave her!
- Take them!
- Sanatan.
- Father, Mala.
Child...
this world is
alienated from you.
Now you must never turn
around and look.
Come child.
Here is your belonging
I trampled on my son's
emotions to keep my word.
A father can be
stone hearted once...
But not always.
- You immoral girl
- Beat me, hit me more.
Instead of dying slowly
kill me for once.
I shall fulfill your
this wish too.
- Sanatan!
- Again his name?
- Now call out his name.
- Enough chief!
Now that you've
saved her life...
guard her honour
until she's married.
I'm going to get some
things for the marriage.
I'll kill each one of you if
she even moves from here.
Don't let her go out of your
sight even for a moment.
- Sir! Sir!
- What is it?
What the hell. Outside the
theater he is playing a flute.
- Flute?
- Yes whoever comes stands there mesmerized.
As if it is a flute belonging
to Lord Krishna.
Great, great,
My friend what is your name?
What will you do with my name?
He is hiding his name.
He looks to me as a real artist
you see this money?
Its not money, that I'm
searching for.
You are not enticed by money then
you don't belong to this earth...
God has sent this great man
for our benefit.
Come with me.
- Where?
- In my theater.
If I knew an artist like you
I've made a theater long back.
Just come for a moment and
grace my theater. Come.
Come in for a moment.
Please come.
Come please have a seat.
I really tell you all
people will go crazy.
Who is that person who
won't give money for your tune?
All men, women, lame, blind
all will come to listen.
- You will get an ovation.
- Boss's treasury will be full.
I say who is the owner of
this theater?
- You or me?
- You.
Just say a yes once.
Then sky will be the limit.
You are the owner.
You are the owner.
So what have you decided?
Has my request been
considered by you?
I will play the flute,
but who will dance on my tune?
Oh my dear, I can get all
kinds of dancers for you.
- No you did not understand.
- I'm an idiot of highest order.
Will you at least explain?
What will you urban people understand
our language from the jungle.
On a snake charmers tune the
he snakes dance euphorically.
I understood everything.
What did you understand?
The artist is truly saying
that the dancer...
should be from the jungle too.
- Yes you are right.
- My friend I will do what...
you say, search the
entire jungle...
and get the beauty
from anywhere.
- Do you agree?
- Agreed! Millions of times.
You get the posters pasted,
and I will announce it publicly.
We need we need there is need...
get your fortune made
change you luck...
we need a beautiful
dancer of this caliber.
Is there any such beauty
who wants fame?
Who wants to make money
her slave.
Such opportunity will not
come again, the one who...
doesn't pay attention
will repent later.
There is a need, there is a need.
- What is this noise?
- This is not a noise...
but a wake up call for
the people to make a fortune.
Is there any girl who is capable
of dancing in the theater?
For a day she will get 1000 Rs.
There is no one here.
Wait! Chief our Mala is here.
You will make her dance on
the stage?
So what 1000 Rs for a day.
We will get a fortune.
Prabir don't get enticed by
money so much that you forget...
- That you'll get married to her.
- The marriage will still be...
there, but I won't get the
opportunity to make money again.
Muscle man agree to his words,
the whole life also if you...
catch snakes.
You won't make a 1000 Rs.
He is right chief,
why are you refusing?
- Please say a yes.
- What is left in saying?
Now you more have the right
over her...
whether you make her
dance or make her sit at home.
- The it is for sure?
- Sure.
- Then show her to me.
- Yes why not?
Sure, sure.
Here is the advance.
- See that she reaches the Roopmati theater.
- Yes.
Prabir you tried to
buy my soul...
But could not buy it.
Now you want to auction this
body in the market?
Do that too.
Sir, the key to success
has come.
Not him.
- What is your name?
- You are the master.
- Go and do your make up.
- Yes, wait Mala.
- First 1000 advance.
- 1000!!
Give it to him sir.
Even in the jungle it is
expensive, here take it.
Hey you disappear from here.
Please come, come.
Artist, I swear on your art
she is a fantastic dancer.
She is born to dance on the
tune of your flute.
Hey lady!
Lady.
Sanatan!
- Is this a dream?
- Not a dream but a fact.
A sample, see her with your
eyes full.
Mala you are here?
I have come here
to dance for this theater.
Prabir is auctioning my body
in the lure of money.
Good that you met me,
or else I wouldn't
have even met you till the last.
Last meeting?
Mala after getting a life afresh
you are talking about death?
Sanatan tomorrow is my marriage
to Prabir.
Your wedding?
Not mine...
But my dead body's wedding.
Look.
I have got my dress ready too.
Tomorrow along with the music
of the wedding...
this snake will put
me at rest forever.
No Mala I will not let you
take your life.
Come on let us run away.
It is very difficult to run
away...
there is my father's
vigilance all over the jungle.
So what either we get away,
or both die together.
I don't want you to lose your
life along with me.
It would be better that
in front of you...
I die in your arms.
Don't say it, after such
a long time...
these love filled eyes
have seen you today.
This is the thirst of
many rebirths Sanatan.
Come on for the dress rehearsal.
The theaters' dress, come on.
Both are great!!
Our Drama, is of lovers, who...
cannot be separated
even by death.
Why is the delay Prabir.
Why isn't the drama starting?
I'll have it started.
Hey!!
- Start the drama.
- Why are you shouting?
Do you know I'm the
fiance of this girl here?
Oh I'm sorry, please
do invite me for the wedding.
- What is this?
- These are English clouds.
We call it gas.
Hey close it
Everything will be spoilt.
What is this smoke!!
There is fire run away.
- Prabir where are you?
- I'm still here. Come.
- Where is my daughter?
- I don't know but I'm ruined.
My 1000 Rs given to him is gone,
I gave you 1000 Rs that too gone.
Tell me where is she or
else I'll burn you theater.
What will you burn, what have
I done, here is a match burn me.
- All ruined.
- Sir, you are the master but...
- Both the actor and the
actress have run away.- Where?
There towards the west, do it
fast or else you will lose her.
Sanatan!
The horse is good.
Make the horse run
faster come on.
- Sanatan, they are following us.
- Hey faster.
Give me the reins.
Here take this money.
Faster, make the horse run,
take this money. Good.
- Take more money.
- Here.
Make him run faster, they will
escape, here take this.
Faster!
Strong, powerful, the one
to provide wealth to a friend...
The one who takes away
enemies life..
Swear on your snake community...
swear on your snake
community's prestige.
Swear on you to ruin
everything...
The enemy should be
helpless oh powerful...
Your poisonous tongue
should attack enemies forehead.
Once, twice, hundred times.
Sanatan's body should be
reduced to ashes.
When I wake up from my
meditation...
Sanatan's cold dead body
should be in front of me.
Snake God identify
where Sanatan is.
Once, twice,
till his body is not reduced
to ashes.
Salutations to you Snake God.
I knew you will surely come
to set me free.
The worshipped snake is coming
towards you to kill you.
- Go run away. - No Mala.
- Don't delay, go run away.
- If I have to run then lets run together.
- No.
- Mala in the path of love
no snake can defeat us - No.
If I come with you then, father
will leave...
no stone unturned to
hunt for me.
He won't leave you alive,
Sanatan you run away.
Bribing me with the urge to live
you are disuniting me from you?
Yes, your life is the essence
of my love...
I will not go away after my
death Sanatan.
In my breath will be your
famous name.
My every breath will have
the fragrance of your love.
They will come
run away from here.
Wait here, I say stop here...
till my sweetheart reaches
you will have to stop.
For the sake of love
and this passion you wait here.
I will swallow all your poison.
I say get back.
Get back!!
I say get back!!
You won't return Al right.
Then bite my hand.
Sanatan now the snake...
has nothing left.
Your devotee drank the entire...
poison thinking it as a potion.
It's time for me to leave.
Without seeing you once this...
soul will not leave the body.
Only one glimpse...
Oh my sweetheart.
One last glimpse Sanatan.
Please do something that
my Mala gets back to life.
Some how get her back
Get her back.
Go and search
those mountains thoroughly.
Pray to all the Gods and
Goddesses...
Go to hermits and gurus.
Go and beg for me.
The one who gives life
to my Mala...
I will give him every
thing that I have.
- What should I do.
- Sanatan, don't lose heart.
Here in the mountain caves
there lives...
a renowned ascetic.
- He has those medicines which
can remove the poison.- Really?
My sweetheart has been
disunited from me...
she has been bitten
by a snake...
Give me such a medicine
or a boon...
so that she comes back to life.
This is no more in
the hands of a human.
If your love has that
power, that quest...
then go and pray
to God for her well being.
With the quest for love knock
the door leading to God.
If the power of love
is heard by God...
Then the one who has bitten
your sweetheart will perish.
"Oh the one who gives life
and the one who takes it away"
"What did you achieve by
snatching away my love."
"The lamp of love is blown off"
"My soul mate is disunited
from me."
"You gave the support
and snatched it away."
"Don't you feel ashamed."
"Snatching away my
peace of mind tell me..."
"What have you achieved."
"The one who gives life
the one who takes away life."
"When did I
ask for moon and stars."
"Why did you take the
light out of my life?"
"Give me my life, bequeath
this love to me."
"Give me the life which I lost."
"Breaking my heart tell me..."
"What have you achieved."
"The one who gives life
the one who takes away life"
Come back Mala.
Break this web of death,
We were on the same path.
We both had taken an oath
then why did you leave half way.
We had taken a oath to be
together in life and death.
Wake up Mala... for once.
I too will leave
this world with you.
I'm coming Mala.
What are you doing?
Leave me... I don't want to
live in this world without Mala.
O lover... Mala is alive.
- She can never leave you.
- No...
She won't come back.
Not even the God of
death can take her away.
"The darkness of the night."
"Listen to me oh my sweetheart."
"Why are you tormenting
please come back."
"When will my dream come
true my sweetheart."
"When you come and call
me as yours."
"Listen to me my sweetheart."
"My moon has hid in the clouds."
"Where are these crazy
eyes searching for it"
"Please come to me
my sweetheart."
"This world has shattered all
my beautiful dreams."
"Weeping away I remember
the past beautiful life."
"Come my sweetheart
my heart is yearning."
"The evening of my life
is about to begin."
"Where are these crazy
eyes searching for you."
"Come to me my beloved"
"My moon has hid
behind the clouds."
The disunited lover
is not found this way.
For the union you will have
to go through a test.
And will have to pass through
a burning fire.
"I went through the
agony of your remembrance."
"Now I will go through
the agony of burning in fire."
"Breaking the high walls
of this world..."
"With all the zeal
I've come to you..."
"Leaving this entire
world for you."
"I got my sweetheart
found my soul mate..."
"I got an entire
new world."
"The spring came swinging
my heart found solace."
"I will not let you turn
away anymore."
"I have come, leaving
this entire world for you."
"Every thing is new and afresh."
"In a new world the
meeting was afresh."
"I won't let you go"
"Breaking the high walls
of this world."
"With all the Zeal
I've come to you."
"Leaving behind the
entire world for you."
Beware, if you touch her.
Prabir now you don't have
any right over her.
What are you saying Chief.
Don't forget that...
I'm engaged to Mala.
- She is my Fiancee.
- Your fiancee gave her life...
This is my daughter's new life
and she belongs only to Sanatan.
The consequence will be very bad.
You will have to face
our tribe's challenge.
- Agreed.
- On my one signal you will face a Catastrophe.
Then I will give up my
life happily for her.
How precious the child can be...
That I realized only
when I lost her.
For Mala I
can sacrifice anything.
That will be seen.
Attention.
Attack and finish all of them.
No chief our weapons will
not raise on lovers.
Mala... my dearest...
