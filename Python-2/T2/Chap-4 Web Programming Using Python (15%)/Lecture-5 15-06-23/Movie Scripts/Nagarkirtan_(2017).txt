Touches my ears
My heart loses All patience here

To my heart's content...
'The Eunuch and the Flute Player'
Oh my dear, Radhe!
We've almost arrived.
Come this side.
Careful.
Get your blood pressure checked.
This is risky.
You stay alone.
It's 12:30 am already.
Don't bother to return today, son.
I'll make you a bed on
the floor.
Get some sleep.
Go back tomorrow.
Go to the rear window and
ask them to open the door.
Must have fallen asleep.-
- No, not yet.
Please sit down.-
- Yes. I'll sit.
Sit.
Hare Krishna...
Sujata, get a bottle of water.
Here's your bottle.
Iron the green blouse too.
Alright.
Another power failure.
The movie was so nice...
This is an everyday story
these days.
Light the lamp.
The TV was on in full volume.
They'll hear us now.
Is this a ladies hostel?-
- Call them.
Coming.
What's wrong with Masterbabu? (Sir)-
- He is very ill.
Come in.
Come.
Okay...
Masterbabu is sick.
I'll go, check.
Careful.
What happened to him?-
- He fainted.
Puti...
Go, get some sleep.
You'll be fine tomorrow.
Suddenly... I blacked out!-
- Show them the light.
Okay.
Go.
Come.
The power's acting up
every night these days.
Come.-
- Tell us if you need anything.
Hare Krishna...
Madhu, come.
Masterbabu...
Masterbabu...
Call me if you need
anything at night.
Yes, dear. Go.
Two tickets to Krishnanagar.
Window seats please.

What do you think?
Let's go.
How many rooms in total for them?
Three rooms, one small bathroom.
But they all bathe in the river.
And... there's a loo.
For 260 bucks?
Only 260 bucks?
I still pay only a 115 bucks
per month for my room.
Because I have a separate loo.
They won't leave.
Many promoters tried.
If they're ousted, they'll have
to be given an apartment.
Who will want to buy the
other apartments then?
Those eunuchs...
She's coming.
Hark the name of Lord Krishna...

Do you like straight hair?
Or a shot haircut?
This is nice.
My real hair is curly.

Nothing.

Okay.
Come on? Lock it!
I will knock thrice, okay?
Like this.
Only then you open.
Don't open it for others.
Lock it.
You're exactly like Subhash-da.
Who is that?
Nobody. He was a teacher.
Lock the door.
Come back soon.
Don't you have a
matching bodice?
Hey...
No.
Sujata...-
- Yes?
Take her to the South today.
Okay.
Have you seen this?
What are you ogling at?
Mala took a selfie with Ishan.
Who is Ishan?-
- From, 'Jamai Raja'.
The TV soap.
Look?-
- Show me.
His car was at the signal.
Gave her a 100 rupee note.
Let me see!
Oh! This is the actor,
Sabyasachi's son!
His real name is Arjun!
Look!
Isn't he cool?
Hey...
Won't you pay me back?-
- In 2 days...
The landlord, the owners...
everyone has given the N.O.C.
In exchange of a big sum.
Surely not alone. They
must've had to share.
The political party, the police...
The local club's there too.
Mr. Prashanta comes
every evening.
He's spoke to Ratan...-
- Madhu, give me a matchstick...
Asked him to send the
names of who refuse.
We're fake tenants. No papers.
I was born in this slum, Madhu.
Where will I go now at this age?
They're asking us to leave
the rooms in four days.
Oh God!
Come.
Let's see what happens.
Whom do you want?
Is Priyanka Chopra here?
Why?
Want to take a selfie?
Come.
Hey, Sir, spare a ten rupee note!
Ten rupees?
I'll be there in two minutes.
Who is this Subhash-da
you mentioned?
Never heard of him before.
I told you...
He used to teach.
He used to give tuitions.
To my elder sister.
To me.
What did he teach?
He taught me many things.
How far, brother?
Gokul-da doesn't have a mobile.
Ask him to call me.
For sure, okay?
Number?
He has mine.
Tell him, I've a serious problem.
What happened?
My ancestral house is in Nabadwip.
I've rented a room in a slum here.
600 bucks along with
electric charges.
I only go back to sleep.
I'm busy delivering for
the Chinese hotel all day.
And when I get called to
play at the Kirtan...
then I'm usually not back
before 11 pm.
I only go back to eat
and sleep off.
I need at least a room for myself.
The promoters are
bringing it down.
They'll build high-rises there.
There you go...
Yes...
Yes, I'm coming.
Got a flat tyre.
I'm coming.
Tell him it's urgent, okay?
I think we've reached.
Where to?-
- The College Principal's office.
You have appointment?-
- Of course!
Mushroom Asparagus.
Mixed Manchurian Hakka.
Okay. Go.
Good morning. Come.
What was that!-
- Just walk.
Please do not cross the barricade.
Let the police do their job.
Did you collect all your luggage?-
- It's kept there.
I hardly have any.
I will do the talking first.
If she asks anything, reply.
Should we tell her we eloped?-
- Absolutely!
She will catch us if we lie!
Stand up!
Please sit.
You two seem quite young.
This year's admissions are over.
What's your name?
I am Madhu. She is Puti.
Puti?
And your proper name?
My proper name...
Parimal.
From that it became Pari and...
And now it's Puti.
'Puti' as in 'tiny'?
No...
She always gets a 'put' (single)
point in the dice game.
That why, 'Puti'.
Usually they call our
kind, 'Chhakka' (sixer).
But our own lives are...
only a single person's path.
Madam...
I've eloped with Madhu-da.
I used to live with the eunuchs
at the Nimtala area of Kolkata.
What's your Guru's name?
Reply.
Arati.
Why have you come to me?
I've seen on the Television, you...
turned into Manabi from Somnath.
Puti is a girl. From her heart.
But her body... if we could...
make it a female body... then...
that's why...
Yes, Madam?
Take them to my quarter.-
- Okay.
You're great, Madam.
A complete lady!
Really!-
- Go, I'll come.
Take them with you.
Go.
Let's go.
Put this to dry.
Have they broken all the houses?
So, from now you will...
stay here?
Not quite.
As long as I don't find a place.
I've to find a place near Hazra.
The hotel is close from there.
God will mend everything.
Trust me.
Thank you.
Why?
Because you remembered
to tell Gokul-da.
It was a big help.
Big help.
Why that dry thank you?
Give me a treat.
With your Chinese food?
The smile isn't enough.
No free lunches.
Puti...
My name.
Hey, Puti...
Puti...
Coming!
Today, Manabi Bandopadhyay is
officially a woman.
But the lady professors of the
college wouldn't let me into the loo.
They will slap it on your
face, what's real and what's fake!
Becoming a woman doesn't mean
you'll become a heroine for them!
One plate chicken fried rice.
One plate boneless chilli chicken.
135 B, Beltala Road.
It's a little urgent, okay?
And listen...
Make that an egg fried rice.
Thank for the help, brother.
So, why have you come to
Krishnanagar, Lord Krishna?
If Puti becomes a woman,
will you marry her?
Or will you too run away
like my husband did?
Not at all, Madam! I swear on God!
My husband used to
swear on God as well!
Should I go?-
- No...
You just came back.
The heat is terrible
today. Take this...
Yes, it's too much.
Many people go to Bihar
for a cheap surgery.
Then they get ruined
by the quack doctors.
I know many who have
died like this.
You see, the cost is huge.
And a prolonged treatment.
It's not over with the surgery.
They'll continue hormone treatments.
I'm still on hormone treatments.
Even now?
If you want to do it
cheap, then suit yourself.
Wait, I'll show you something.
Madhu-da...
You know, clay dolls of
Krishnanagar are world famous.
They must do a job
as intricate as this.
They must build a woman's
body bit by bit, just like God.
I am giving this to you.
Keep this with yourself.
Don't get bogged down
because you're a eunuch.
I am the head of a college today.
Right?
This is my biography.
Do read it.
Please teach her to be
just like you.
How far has she studied?
Till the 7th standard.
Academics isn't my cup of tea.
So...
in order to become a
woman completely...
as in, for a full body surgery...
how much will it cost?
No, wait.
Tell me how much
half the body will take?
Tell me the price
separately, top and bottom.
Oh come on...-
- We'll do it as and when we have money.
In instalments.
Not possible?
Is it very painful?
The pain you're living with,
it's nothing compared to that, Puti.
Not again...
Have...
I'll go.
Stop!
I will go.
Biting off more than
you can chew!?
Don't argue back.
Listen...
We too are quite fond of Chinese.
If you want to give a treat...
we're ten of us.
Do not go for a separate plan.
Go.

Eager, she sets out

O, the plight of dear Radha!
Stop crying and eat.
Everything will be fine.
Here...
Eat.
We will never have so much money.
Told you, I will arrange for it.
I will save up every month.
I have two golden rings.
It won't be enough.
Come on...
I have my share of land
back at home.
At Nabadwip.
The land of Mahaprabhu Chaitanya.
It'll bear a lot of
money if I sell it.
Here.
Have it.-
- I will. You eat.
Sharing food once is unlucky.
Finish eating and pack
up the bags.
Come on.
We'll leave tomorrow.
Where are we going?
Nabadwip.
We'll take a bus and
then a ferry from there.
Where will we stay?
At my place.
Will they take us in?

Touches my ears
My heart loses All patience here

Hello, Chinese Wall?
Yes, please take it down.
One plate chowmein...
Yes.
Do that.
And a plate of
chilli chicken with that.
Write down. 301...
Hazra lane.
Yes, ground floor.
Please make it fast.
I'm in hurry, okay?
Please make it fast.
Okay. Okay, fine.
People mostly worship
Goddess Kali or Durga.
But my God is...
Shri Chaitanya.
They married him off forcefully.
What good did it do?
His wife, Bishnupriya
would cry all day.
Her husband wasn't
interested in the home.
And why would he be?
He had given up his
heart, his life, his body...
everything for Lord Shri Krishna.
Drowning himself in
Krishna's love as his lover, Radha.
Take care of Him.
My stomach is aching.-
- What some medicine?
Let me wait a bit.
No... I' must go to the loo.
I've to go again.-
- Go.
All that Chinese food
didn't go down too well...
Let me carry it.-
- It's okay.
Come, sit here.
No problem, right?-
- Not at all.
I ordered for it.
You left for the land of Mathura

Poor them!
Your parents can't hold their own!
Poor them!
What happened?
What happened?
Why did you get scared
and leave?
I was anyway looking for a house.
Scared of a scandal?-
- Yes, that too.
Well, let there be one.
Who is she to control you?
Is she your Guru?
Who you'll be friends with...
will she decide that for you?
Why are you so scared?
Would I have texted you
this address if I was scared?
Do you love me?
As in?
But I love you.
Don't you feel like seeing me?
That I do.
That's it.
That's it!
You do love me.
You've caught feelings.
That's why you got
scared and fled.
Not our Guru...
You're scared of yourself, Madhu-da.
But I am fighting the crocodile
staying in the water.
You're still on land, Madhu-da!

Won't it be a problem at home?
Had to face it some day.
I work at the hotel, that's all.
No need to talk about
the home delivery bit.
A big hotel. That's it.
They'll ask a hundred questions.
If you think you're in trouble,
pretend to be lost in thought.
Just start crying. Tell them
you're missing your home.
This is no joke.
Be careful.
What if they ask my
parents' names?
Say the truth.
Malay Dutta, Rekha Dutta,
My sister, Reena.
And me...
Guru-ma hasn't given
me a proper name yet.
She used to call me Pari.
Your sister's called Reena...
Rinku. Rinku Dutta.
Rinku Dutta.
You mustn't call me
'Puti' by mistake.
That could be my
personal name for you.
People have names for loved
ones... Buchu, Kutli, Gutli...
Like that.
For me, it's Puti.
Your Guru will give
you a good shelling.
You're sneaking out to
meet me everyday!
But you're doing that
too, right?
Only if she gets to know.
People give us weird stares
even around your home.
Soon the club will intervene.
This place is far better.
Whatever fate has to offer.
Some lovers romance
sitting at Victoria memorial.
And we're smelling crap here
standing beside the drain.
Hey.
What are you thinking?
Nothing...
What 'nothing'?
Of course you're thinking.
Spill it out.
Is this really possible?
Between two males...
Can two boys fall for
each other?
Well it's happening!
You leave your work and come.
I am also taking the risk to come.
Why?
Because it is happening.
Please be honest, Madhu-da...
When we were making out...
did you feel like I was a boy?
Because I am actually
a girl, Madhu-da!
They couldn't make me a boy just
by making me wear a shirt and pants.
I've been like this since birth!
A girl.
I have the wrong body.
I've to make it right.
When we made mistakes in math,
we'd calculate it again...
Just like that.
I'm not getting a
haircut these days!
I've a good mop.
See?
It's become so long!
I'll make it reach my
shoulders in a year.
Please look!
Once I make a nice
parting with a braid,
you won't be able to look away!
What's my fault here?
Wear the hair.
Until your hair grows long don't
open it in front of me, Puti.
Never do that.
I don't like it.
Please help me a little,
Madhu-da!
I will make all the
calculations right for you.
There won't remain even an inch
of Parimal left in this body.
Give me your phone. And take mine.
Is your father hot tempered?-
- No...
My brother is the serious kind.
But no anger. They're very calm people.
Otherwise I wouldn't bring you.
Who else is there at home?
My brother's wife and
her son, Gaja. He is six.
Hope you know how to cook?-
- Yes.
Fish, chicken, veggies, eggs...-
- We're Vaishnavas! Vegetarians!
Not even onions or eggs! Only
lentils, rice and fried veggies.
But you lapped up all
the meat in the hotel!
You can't maintain
all that in the city!
Don't ever bring it up at home.
Maa will throw us out right away!
What will you say if
they ask about me?
I will say the truth.
You're my friend.
A friend...
Actually, say it in English,
sounds better. Girlfriend.
Girlfriend?
You ordered at Chinese Wall.-
- Wait.
Madam was waiting for
you. Went for a bath.
She'll come out and pay.-
- Water please?
Okay.
If the human being is not a man from
his thinking, his soul, his heart...
The woman inside him
chocks to death...
Like a shackled Goddess.
Such a life is rather a curse.
Even though Somnath
had admirers, he was alone.
Water.-
- When he became Manabi...
Please switch on the fan.
She found the river to flow in.
That's how I felt complete.
I could flow like a river.
May the woman inside you...
come out to your body...
What you want...
when you look at yourself
in the mirror...
You want to see a beautiful
woman's reflection to be created.
The woman you have been
hiding inside you since childhood,
the child of your
thought process,
who is you in totality,
bring that 'You'...
out in the open.
Hello?
Hello?
Speak louder...
Don't listen to them. Take
advice form an educated person.
Speak to someone who knows.
You won't believe your eyes,
Madam used to be a man!
They're showing her
pictures of before and after.
Yes.
She is the Principal of
Krishnanagar College.
I know where it is, I will
take you to Krishnanagar.
A complete woman's body!
Don't worry about the cost.
My home's at Nabadwip.
It's on the same route!
Yes.
That's what I am saying!

Come, fast!
Let's go!
Thamma! (Grandma)
Thamma!
What is it?
Why are you shouting?
I will tell Thamma.
Tell me what it is?-
- What is it?
Chhotka. (Uncle)
Chhotka?
What about him?-
- Chhotka is here!
There's a girl with him!
Hark Lord Krishna.-
- Yes.
Hark, Lord Krishna.-

How are you?-
- Bless you.
My mother.
My blessing to you, dear.
May Lord Krishna bless you.
My Dada (elder brother).
No...
Look at you, Thakurpo(brother-in-law)!
Couldn't you call once?
Boudi(sister-in-law).
She is Rinku.
Seek blessings.
That's enough.
May Lord Krishna bless you.
Who is she?
My friend.
Really? She's got
such a pretty face!
Should I cook or have you eaten?-
- We ate at the ferry-station.
Give me some water.
Yes.
Sit. I'll be back.
Dada.
What are you staring at?
Seek blessings!
May Radha and Krishna bless you!
Please sit, dear.
Sit.
What's wrong with this harmonium?
What's wrong with it?-
- One key is acting up.
Rinku had some work at
Krishnanagar. We came from there.
She really...
Hey Raja... come here!
He is always running around.
What work did you have at Krishnanagar?-
- Her sister's place.
She couldn't come alone.
So I brought her.
Seems there's a show tonight?
It's Holi festival tomorrow. There's a
Kirtan programme at the Ray Choudhury's.
Did you get your flute?-
- Yes.
Will you play today?-
- Yes.
Of course.
Chhotka, Maa is calling you.
Weren't you eager to
listen to Kirtan? Wish granted.
I'll take you today.
Dear...
Where's your home?
Bagnan.

Indian independence...

Club has organised...

The child who acquired
the first place is...
Parimal.
Parimal Dutta.
He has dressed up as
Mother Sarada.
A big round of applause please!
Come, son.
Let us give you your award!
Parimal's sister is bringing him.
We have the President of the district
committee of Bagnan to give the award.
Mr. Amitabha Ghosh!
Everyone, please give Parimal a
huge round of applause!
What is it?
Am I guessing it right?
How will I know what you're
guessing? Where's the matchbox?
Don't act smart now, tell me!
Where's the matchbox?
Over there!
Your mother and brother are
leaving for the Kirtan. Wait a little.
How old is she?
Looks like a kid!
No, she is 18. Adult!
Brilliant! What else?
Jump into it!-
- Quiet, please!
Why are you so scared?
I am there.
Where is Baba(father)?-
- At the temple.
Come.
You know, dear...
our family has been singing
Kirtans for three generations now.
You know Kirtans?-
- Yes.
My younger son too learnt the
Kirtan and flute in the family itself.
We sing Kirtans for a living.-
- Here, water.
Madhu was the first one
to enter a different profession.
He said he wanted to go to
Kolkata to find a job.
Times are changing, you see.
Kirtan singers aren't as respected
or sought after like earlier.
But I do play there.
There's one group at Kalighat.
Very few shows though.
Funerals, etc.
Sometimes shows come from the
village areas. Nungi, Champahati,
Nepalganj, New Barrackpore, that's it.
Is it a big group?
More or less. Many people play.
Two for each instrument.
Two flutes, two Khol drums.
But one violin.
The lady has a very nice voice.
Hey... Gaja...
Go keep the glass.
Hey, Gaja, please take
aunt's glass too.
Yes, son.
Have you heard Madhu play?
Yes.
Hey...
When did you hear?
Why? At our place?
Near Gokul-da's room.
Good lord! You've been
to her house already?
You all were so
worried about the boy...
because some astrologer
said he won't have a family life...
The lad's doing it all!-
- Chuck this for now.
Maa, let's go.
How long are you here?
Only two days.
We'll go tomorrow.
But it's Holi (festival
of colours) tomorrow.
You won't find transport.
Go day after.
Yes, actually, listen...
There's a lady with you. Everyone
will be drunk. Don't go tomorrow.
Maa, let's go.
We're coming too.
Let's go.
Hark, Lord Krishna.-
- Careful.
Gaja, hurry up.
Will you take a bath?-
- No, I bathed in the morning.
Okay. Fine.
Just freshen up a bit then.
Sleep with me tonight.
We don't have extra rooms.
Gaja... go fast!
The brothers will sleep here.
You can sleep with me.
Listen...
hope her parents are
okay with this?
As in?
As in...
do her parents know
you brought her here?
What do you think?-
- Okay, nothing, Go in. Come soon.
Okay?
Bye.
Come on.
Do come soon.
Burn the old witch off today
Tomorrow we have Holi colours to play
It's a full moon night tonight
Call Hari, he will heal your plight
Burn the old witch off today
Tomorrow we have Holi colours to play
You have beautiful hair,
like those actors on TV.
Do you shampoo everyday?
Yes...
Three days in a week.
Sit, will you?
Sit.
I don't find the time at all.
There's always so much
work to finish at home.
I'm lucky if I can wash my
hair once a week.
Hey...
you must go to
the parlour regularly...
Yes.
Wow!
Can't get enough of you, can he?
Hey... will you
change?
No, I only wore this
today morning.
Sit.
Thakurpo, you will be
playing at Kirtan, right?
Right?-
- Yes.
Won't you change?-
- I'll find something.
Hey, please don't sit here.
I will change the sari.
Go outside.
Where are you going?
Sit here, lock the door.
Hark, Lord Krishna!
Should I fold the sari for you?
No, thanks.
I'll let it breathe for sometime.
I used to be
slim like you earlier.
I put on weight after
Gaja was born.
I work so hard. At the
school, at home...
I wipe the floor everyday.
But I can't lose the fat.
To add to that, my husband
wants another kid now!
As if one monkey wasn't enough,
now he wants another!
But men will never
understand all this.
He wants what he wants.
It was so difficult when
Gaja was to be born...
It was summer.
And I had that huge belly!
It was very painful!
Hey...
Don't attend calls during the Kirtan.
Keep it on silent mode.
Look...
who has come to see you!
I'll be there in a bit.
Stop dabbling with that.
Look, who is here!
The school teacher will come
to take this watch by 8 pm.
Don't even have the time
to turn around once?
Look!
Who is it now?
See. Mother Sarada is here!
Look, he has come first!
By dressing up!-
- In the Go As You Like.
Good. Very nice.
Go to your room and
study with your sister.
And Reena, remove his
make up right away. Go.
Come.
The boy won a cup!
Look how his Dad is reacting!
You could've given him
a hug at least!
'Good. Very nice'.
That's all?
This is the hundredth
time I'm saying this,
don't make Parimal wear
women's clothes.
This was a Go As You
Like competition!
Right. Why not dress up
as a boy then?
He wanted to be Mother Sarada...-
- And you agreed?
Don't you know he's always
been fond of your cosmetics?
He likes wearing Reena's clothes!
Just a kid's fancy...
Not just a fancy.
Are you blind? Don't you see it?
The way he walks and talks,
everything is different. Like a girl.
If you allow this now,
his future will be ruined later.
Have you seen
Shibnath-da's elder son?
People taunt him to be a girl!
The younger brother is married
but no luck with that guy.
You're stupid so you don't get it.
One more day you put make up
on him, I will leave this house!
All of you are blind idiots!
My Hari is gone
To the land of honey, Mathura
Leaving behind our love...
We, the family women...
I lie abandoned on the
roadside, as if
A garland used and thrown away
My friend, I lie abandoned
on the roadside as if
A garland used and thrown away
You know, my dear friend
As long as your Krishna
lived in the Vrindavan
I had all the happiness
All the joy
But...
Once that our Krishna left
My heart
Is now bereft of all the joy
I lie abandoned on the roadside
As if a garland used
and thrown away
My fate is such now...
My fate is such now...
Like a garland thrown away
My fate is such now...
I don't feel like
going back home.
Again that crowded train.
The train will be empty
on the way back.
Did you hear me?
I did.
What did I say?
Vidyasagar.
What did he do?
You irritate me a lot.
He swam through this Damodar
river on a stormy night...
when he heard his
mother was ill.
Everything is possible if you
have the will power, Pari.
Do you have the will power?
Could I come here with you
on a festive day if I didn't?
This is just a few stations
away from home.
If you can, take me to America.
Why America?
Marriage between two males
is legal there, Subhash-da.
Can you?
You're so good in studies!
You can sit for the exam!
You've a sure chance!
You're crazy!
And then two of us can elope...
You said one can do it
with will power...
Shubhash-da...
Whom do I ask?
What do I say?
My dear friend, hear me out
How do I spend these
Long days and nights?
How do I spend these
Long days and nights?
In this Vrindavan
bereft of Krishna
How am I to pass the
long days and nights?
How am I to pass the
long days and nights?
In this Vrindavan
bereft of Krishna
How am I to pass the
long days and nights?
In this Vrindavan
bereft of Krishna
How am I to pass the
long days and nights?
Hark now the names
Nitai, Gaur and the beloved Hari!
In the name of the Hari!
Hark the name of the Hari
Hark the name of the Hari!
Hark the name of the Hari
Hark the name of the Hari!
Hark now the names
Nitai, Gaur and the beloved Hari!
You continue.
In summer, the river
Hardly has water
So the cattle can cross and...
What is it, Pari?
Are you getting married
to my sister?
Yes.
Your father suddenly proposed...
And what about me?
You're a disgusting man!
Pari.
Pari...
Thank you.
Pari!
Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare
Hare Rama Hare Rama
Rama Rama Hare Hare
Hare Krishna Hare Krishna
Krishna Krishna Hare Hare
Parimal, will you dress up
your own bride too?
There's this young boy who
gives my daughter tuitions.
I'll get rid of him!
What did Subhash come to teach?
And what did he end up teaching?
Pari, have you paid
Subhash this month's salary?
Please don't be sad...
The groom is here!
Let's go!
♪ Madhu-da Calling ♪
Hello.
Where are you, Puti?
I am at the riverside.
How did your hair open?
Anyway, forget it. We
had to tell someday!
You can't live a
fake life forever!
No big deal! Just come back!
It's not your fault that you've
a man's body! It's God's mistake!
How can a person have a different
heart and a different body?
They've to understand this!
Eunuchs too are people, like us!
It's no issue, just come! Besides,
you'll change the entire body!
Only then we'll come back!
If they still don't accept,
I don't need this family!
Please come back! Nothing is
wrong! Just come, please!
Thakurpo...
Listen.
This time that you leave,
kindly do not step into
this house again.
And...
In so many years, not
one person could...
point their finger at this
family of Kirtan singers.
You've assured that
it happens now.
Didn't you feel ashamed
for once?
Just get out.
Get out!
Thakurpo...
Her mobile phone.
And this.
Did you find her?
No.
Go.
And, listen...
Keep this.
There's 2000 bucks.
I don't have anymore.
Go.
Listen...
Please call me!
How can you refuse colours
on a Holi day?
Come out, everyone!
Don't be scared of colours!
Holi is here!
Be generous today! For
some meat and rice today!
As if you can't afford meat
without my money?
Wait.
Here...
Let's go.-
- We can't afford the potatoes but.
Pay us for some potatoes then!?
Be gone now!-
- May God bless you and your business!
Babli, take it.

We've got the potatoes!
Now give us some tomatoes!

- Please pay!
How many times should I pay?
We'll get only seeds in 50
bucks. Please pay another 20!
But I did give another one of you
a fifty. Now go. No business today.
Why are you lying? We just
came. Who collected from you?
Another one.-
- Anyway, let's go.
How can you refuse colours
on a Holi day?
Come out, everyone!
Don't be scared of colours!
May God bless you!
Put your head forward,
I'll put some colour!
Now you're putting colour on
it, soon you'll cut my head off!
If you insist dear...
then put some colour. Go ahead.
Pay anything you like.
It's a festive day...
The business is very sad.
Hardly any customers. Take.
But...
A little while ago...
another one from your clan
came to collect money.
If you keep coming back so many
times a day, I've to close my shop!
We don't have another else here.-
- What!
She was a young one...
She clapped and took
30 bucks from me.
Where did she go?-
- That way.
Go, check.-
- Where did she go?
Take your money, Grandpa.
Why must you pay twice?
Neha...-
- Yes, Guru-ma?
Give back the money
we collected.
Come with me!
How can you refuse colours
on a Holi day?

Come out, everyone!
Don't be scared of colours!
What's your name?
Puti.-
- Speak up! Louder!
Were you collecting
money from the market?
I lost my bag. I was
very hungry, so...
You liar!
Who is your Guru? Speak up!
Come on!
From Kolkata... Arati.
Show me your license!
Where are the papers?
You've come from Kolkata
to Nabadwip to collect money?
Give us your Guru's
phone number!
I don't have a phone...-
- One tight slap!
Stop it!-
- Move away from my shop!
Go to that side.-
- Fine, we will go!
Trust me, I lost my phone!-
- Let's get this fellow!
Come on! Let's take this one there!
Come with us!
Give us your phone number!-
- What are you doing here?
How much money have you
collected? Take it out!
One good shelling and
you'll be fine!
Faking it as a eunuch, eh?
Come on, take out the money!
Give us the money!-
- This is all I have...
Please let me go! I collected
money to go home!
Take all of this!
Mala, pass the stool.
Sit.
What's your name?
Parimal.
Pari (angel).
Is that so?
A fallen angel it seems.
Who sent you here?
They aren't sent by
anyone. They just come.
They come on their own.
The Bargabhima temple
in Tamluk district...
There's a well in there.
Everyday a Sole fish
enters that well.
Where it comes from...
And when?
There's no answer to that.
But it comes.
At the temple, they sacrifice...
that Sole fish everyday.
Not one day goes amiss.
That's how our fallen angel...
Pari... has arrived here.
Know how to dance?
Sandhya...
Take her inside.
Change her clothes and
bring her.
Go with Didi (sister).
Come.
Listen...-
- Yes?
Check if it gets hard.
And listen,
will you be able to stay here?
Once the Sole fish enters the well...
it can't go back to the river.
Will you remember that?
Go.
Have you seen this girl here?
Have you seen her?
The clouds have dispersed
It is a holiday today, brother!
So we are set free
It is a holiday today, brother!
So we are set free
Stop!
A eunuch dancing to Tagore's song?
Hark, the name of Lord Rama
Hark, the name of Lord Krishna
Brother...
Have you seen this girl anywhere?-
- Ask over there.
They will know.
Have you seen this girl?
No. Ask someone else.
Brother, have you seen this girl?
No...
Who can fathom the game of love?

My dear love

Come, dance...
Only the one who is bit by love
Knows what it is
Only the one who is bit by love
Knows what it is
Who can fathom the game of love?
My dear love
Who can fathom the game of love?
Love isn't planned, my friend
It just happens
The heartbeats run fast
Full of deep sighs
Love isn't planned, my friend
It just happens
The heartbeats run fast
Full of deep sighs
The heart breaks
But you remain silent
Have you seen this girl?
The eunuch?
She was begging in
the wrong area...
The local eunuchs...
They found out.
They picked her up!
You've no idea how much
they beat her! Just an hour ago...
She wasn't really a eunuch.
He was a man!
He dressed up as a
eunuch to collect money!
That's it! I've made a
video of that!
See... do you know him?
Thank God the police saved him.
They would've killed him!
Here, look...
Please believe me, I
didn't do anything!
Please let me go!
Please believe me...
Open your clothes!
Now turn!
Turn!
Open it! Open all your clothes!
Please let me go! Please!
Leave me! Let go off me!
I swear, I didn't do anything!
Hit him! We should just kill him!
Please leave me!
Yes, put the colour on him!
Put the colour!

Say it! Say, that you're a man!
I am a man!-
- Yes, say it!
Say it on camera, that you defamed
us eunuchs my faking to be one!
I dressed up as a eunuch...
Say it loudly! Say that
you won't ever do this again!
Say it loudly! And hit him!
Beat the hell out of him!
Hit him harder!

Everybody, make a video of this!
Put it up on Facebook for everyone!

Okay, I get it.
Must have deceived
you as a girl.
These people usually
have a gang.
They steal, they rob.
You can't catch them how

They peddle drugs too.
Where are you from?
Nabadwip.
Is that so?
How could you get into all this?
You're wearing a Tulsi garland!
A pure Vaishnava boy!
Why try the non-vegetarian stuff?

You see...
the government has made
jail-rooms for men and women.
But there are no jail-rooms
for the third gender.
Where's this chap from?
From Nabadwip too?
Kolkata.
There you go! I knew it!
Rascal's from the city!
Listen to me.
Talk to him, send him home.

Take my advice.
