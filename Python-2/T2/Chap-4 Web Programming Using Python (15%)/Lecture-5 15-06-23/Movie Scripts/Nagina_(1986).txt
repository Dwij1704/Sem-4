[Birds - Chirping]
Janardhan.
- Yes, madam.
Why is this vase empty?
- I am just putting them in.
Decorate all the flower
vases with flowers.
Flowers should be seen everywhere.
Don't worry.
I will put them right now.
Hey Chanda!
- Yes?
My son is coming back from abroad.
He won't like all these.
Keep these inside.
And take out the bone china
dinner-set from inside..
..and use it.
- Yes.






I just remember this small child.
15 years have passed.
And each year passed as
if 15 ages have passed.
Sister-in-law! What is this?
You have tears in your eyes!
Today you should be happy.
After 15 years your son..
..is returning home.
- Yes, brother.
They are the tears of happiness.
I am a mother.
That is why I'm longing
to see my son.
[Chuckling]
You also did a strange thing!
God had given you only one son.
Mr. Raja is also no more.
Even then, you kept your son away..
..from yourself so many years.
- Yes.
It was Mr. Raja's decision.
Actually, at the age of six..
..I don't know what happened
to Raju suddenly!
He used to be scared at night
and used to get up..






..shouting in his sleep.
Then used to run out of the palace!
Moreover, he used to get scared
of his own shadow too!
Many doctors treated him.
We also tried other treatments.
But it was of no use!
Then one doctor told us that
if he goes somewhere far away..
..from here, then maybe
he would be alright.
Those days my brother
had come from the U.S.
That's it. With a heavy heart,
I sent Raju with him.
After going there,
he became alright.
And today, after completing
his studies, he is..
..coming back after 15 years.
Hasn't Vijaya come?
- How can this be possible, aunt?
I have been here since a long time.
It was me who made the
gardener pluck..
..the flowers and make the bouquets.
Even I was thinking that some
beautiful girl must have only..
..decorated such beautiful flowers!
The young master has come, mistress.
What? My son has come.
Raju!
- Mother!
Mother!
You have grown so much!
Where have you left my little Raju?
I was always with my mother.
I don't know why did you..
..sent me so far away!
- Well said!
Son, he is Mr. Ajay Singh.
Your father's friend.
After him, he has only taken
care of the entire business.
Greetings.
- May you live long!
He is also a partner in our
farms and sugarcane factory.
You may say that all the hard
work is done by him..
..and it's us who reap the benefits!
- Thank you very much, sir.
And she is his daughter, Vijaya.
She has just finished her
studies from Shantiniketan.
She used to spend time with
me in her childhood.
Recently when I was ill, she really
took a lot of care of me..
..much more than what my own
daughter would have done!
She is like my own daughter.
Sister, I have kept her here
for your happiness.
She is only yours.
Greetings, young master!
- Greetings.
They are your own people son,
who are waiting to see you..
..since a long time.
Come. Come inside.
Please come in!
Your son has returned after
15 years. Give him your..
..blessings so that he completes
all your unfinished work.
Like your forefathers,
keep up the family name!
Wow! What a good fragrance is
coming from these suitcases!
Must be Evening in Paris.
I will get one bottle.
And my wife will get one bottle.
Mr. Munshi, why did you
carry this luggage?
Where are the servants?
- They have gone to carry..
..the old luggage. I don't
get to carry such new..
..and shining luggage!
- Mr. Munshi, it is very heavy.
I have the habit of carrying
weight 10 times..
..greater than this.
Ok, Mr. Munshi,
so it means that you do weight lifting!
No. I do wife lifting.
Wife lifting? - Bringing up
a fat wife is not less than..
..weight lifting.
- So Mr. Munshi, you consider your wife..
..as a burden? - Not a burden,
my child. Weight lifting.
It so happened that one day, a slim
and trim, attractive woman..
..was waiting for a bus.
I was traveling by Queen mother's
car and snoring away.
I gave that waiting
girl lift in the car.
This weight lifting
turned into love.
Love turned into marriage.
And my wife Bhanumati..
..started becoming fat. She
bloated up like an elephant.
In olden days, the kings and
emperors used to tie..
..elephants in their courtyard.
I tied a she-elephant
in my own house.
Even today, I have to take 10
kilos of sweets. That too..
..'motichoor laddoo
(gram flour sweets).'
Bhanumati has set up her home..
..in such a haphazard way!
Where did I go and break my head?
[Laughing]
Ok, sister-in-law. We will
leave now. - Ok brother.
Ok aunty.
Leave Vijaya here only. Tomorrow
when Raju comes there..
..he will drop her.
As you wish! Ok Raju.
- Ok daddy.
[Night Insect]
Why did you choose only
Shantiniketan for..
..your studies?
- From the beginning itself, I was..
..interested in music and art.
And where other than..
..Shantiniketan could I
get both these things?
Ok. Shall I ask you one thing?
- Yes.
15 years is not a very short
time. After spending so..
..many years in London,
how come you decided..
..to return?
[Chuckling]
This I had decided from the
beginning itself, that after..
..completing my studies,
I will return to my country.
To my house, to my mother.
Tell me, that the tree which
has it's roots here..
..how can it bloom far away?
- You are right.
Mother, father, you. Finding
so many of your own people..
..even I am forgetting
Shantiniketan slowly.
That means you are not
planning to do M.A.
[Chuckling]
If you tell me to, I will
definitely do it. I have..
Raju, it's too late at night.
Come inside.
Let's go. After you.
- Thank you.
[Chuckling]
You had gone for horse riding
early in the morning?
Yes. I am very fond of riding.
Are you also fond of it? - No.
[Humming]
The vehicles are ready, master.
Yes. Mr. Munshi,
what is this caravan?
Master, what does this man
know about which vehicle..
..does the rider like?
In the morning, you had
gone on horseback.
These are horses made of iron.
This is an open-air horse..
..just like flying in
a flying chariot.
No one can catch it! Please come.
This is a jeep. A hunter's vehicle.
Climbs mountains and..
..surges ahead!
And this an ambassador.
Mother's ambassador!
And many ghosts are scared of it!
And this is Maruti. The son of the
wind. It goes like the wind.
And this is the Victoria
belonging to..
..Queen Victoria's era.
Victoria number. 203.
I had searched for a diamond
in it. But I didn't get it.
You may look for it.
Maybe you'll get it.
Mr. Munshi, I have traveled
a lot in cars.
This will be something unusual!
Ms. Vijaya, would you
like to go in a cart?
I am ready to go with you in
whatever you say. - That's nice!
Let me climb up.
Wow!
[Horse Carriage]
Such a beautiful weather.
Such a beautiful journey.
The companion is beautiful.
Even the horses know this.
What is that place there?
- That? Don't you know?
No. - This is a very old palace.
Your forefathers used..
..to live in it. Some 100-125 years
back, when that new..
..palace was made, they
left this palace.
Since then, it is left isolated.
The temple of our household
deity is also there in it.
There is a temple?
- Yes. Lord Shankar's temple.
[Horses - Whinny]
What has happened to these horses?
I wonder what has happened to them.
[Yelling]
Vijaya!
Oh my God! I'm terribly sorry!
Those horses.. - No. Nothing at all.
Do one thing. Sit behind. Come. Sit.
[Groaning]
Are you very hurt?
- No. It's ok.
[Screaming]
A snake!
You sit here comfortably.
- Why did you come back early?
It so happened mother, that on the
way, the horses got wild.
What has happened to Vijaya?
Nothing aunt. It's just
a small sprain.
Chanda, just put salt in warm
water and bring it here.
Is it paining very much, dear?
Nothing has happened to me,
aunty. But Mr. Rajeev..
..really got saved today.
- How?
It so happened that a snake
tried to bite him.
It was good that he had worn
long boots. Otherwise..
..I don't know what
would have happened.
Raju.
- What's the matter mother?
What do you think, that if you
don't tell me, I will not come to know?
But what happened, mother?
- What is Vijaya saying?
These girls can't even keep
a small thing to themselves.
Such small incidents keep
happening in life.
Now you only tell me that
if the horses get wild..
..and become uncontrolled and
move ahead, then how am I at fault?
And what did I
know that the snake was..
..hiding there to bite me?
- No son. Don't say this..
..even as a joke! You don't
know after so many prayers..
..I have got you. And with a
heavy heart, in order to..
..save you, I kept you away from
me for 15 years. In the hope..
..that in my old age, I will
get to see your happiness.
You are the one who will build
the next generation.
If something happens to you, then
there will be no reason..
..for me to live. I want your
happiness. I want you to live.
Oh! Come on, mom! It's nothing
like that. You don't worry.
Mr. Munshi, call up Mr. Ajay Singh.
Tell him that he should
come in his..
..car and take Raju
and Vijaya with him.
Son, the farms that you can see
spreading out in the distance..
..all those belong to you.
And that one.
That factory is the sugar factory.
That too is yours. Since the last
many years we have been..
..getting awards from
the government for..
..the highest production of sugar.
- Look at this.
But since the last two years,
the production decreased..
..very much. Last year it did
not rain. And this year..
..the insects ate away
the sugarcane crop.
What is your fault in it? As
it is, you have done so many..
..favors for us that it is
difficult to repay you.
No son. It was my duty. Now since
you have come, you can..
..take care of your business.
And free me from all the..
..responsibilities. - No uncle.
Don't put me into trouble..
..from now itself. Please, uncle!
Ok Mr. Munshi let's leave.
No, Mr. Munshi. Do one thing.
The money must have come..
from the bank. You can go and
distribute the salaries to the..
..workers. I will drop him.
- You go. A pot! No, it's an award!
What happened to this damned car?
What has happened?
I'll just check it out.
It seems that it has become hot.
This driver does not check
whether there is water..
..in the car or not.
You sit here only, son.
I will fill water from
that lake and come.
[Anklet Jingle]
Who is it?
What happened? - Nothing.
- Then how did you come here?
It's been so long since
I put water in the jeep..
..and have been waiting for you.
Let's go. Come on.
Today when I saw those ruins,
I felt something strange.
I felt as if an unknown thing
was pulling me towards it.
With which I have
a deep relationship.
I didn't even come to know
when my feet took me there.
Actually, there was no one there.
But I could hear the
anklet's sound so clearly..
..that I felt that
someone was walking with me.
Maybe it is my imagination but then..
..what noise was that which
is still echoing in my ears?
Whatever it is. Till the time
I don't find the secret behind..
..that sound, I will keep
going in those ruins.
[Thunder]
[wind]
Close the window, sir.
The weather isn't good.
Who are you? - I am the watchman
of this place, sir.
Why do you people need
to carry a gun?
There is a lot of fear
of dacoits here.
But don't get scared.
As long as we are here..
..no one can do anything
here. Alright, sir.
Greetings, sister-in-law.
- Please come.
Greetings aunt.
- May you live long! Well!
Where are you preparing to go?
- We were going to the city.
We thought of taking Rajeev
along with us. - Yes.
Where is he?
- Greetings.
May you live long!
- Fine.
So the plans have already been made?
That's why he is ready.
Yes mother, I wanted
to go somewhere.
You are coming with us, aren't you?
- No, uncle.
Some other time. Today I have
to go somewhere else.
Then where are you going?
- Mother, I have some work.
So please excuse me today.
- Raj..

What are you looking at?
- Were you singing this song?
Yes. Did you recognize me?
- No.
Do you recognize this place?
Yes, I had come here yesterday.
[Chuckling]
I am not talking about yesterday.
Years ago, both of us used to play
here together. - Both of us?
Yes. We used to play here
and sing and dance.
Don't you remember anything?
- What are you saying?
I don't understand anything.
I haven't come here
before yesterday.
I knew that you would
forget all this.
But you weren't like this.
I have been waiting for you
since such a long time!
See, these ruins which
was once a palace..
..we both had spent so much time
here together. Come here.
Come. See this temple.
Recognize this place?
- Now how should I..
Is this snake the same one who
had tried to bite me yesterday?
No, no. It's dead.
Did you remember anything?
Try. You will remember everything.
What's the matter?
What happened?
- Nothing. Just felt a bit dizzy
Did you remember anything?
- No.
Actually you were very young.
And one day, you left me crying..
..and went to an unknown world.
Where everything was new for you.
But I had only this place with me
and the time that I had spent..
..with you. Years passed.
For me, time stopped where it was.
As time passes, old memories
can surely fade..
..but they aren't forgotten.
Slowly, I will make you
remember everything.
When will you come next?
- What is your name? - Rajni.
Where do you stay?
- Come. I will show you.
Look, there is a village
behind that mountain.
A river flows beside the village.
There is a temple beside the
river and beside that only..
..is my house. But
you come here only.
I will wait for you here.
Raju dear, why haven't
you slept as yet?
Just like that, mother.
I'm not feeling sleepy.
Hey dear, I hope you are fine, aren't you?
- Yes mother.
Fine. Mother, tell me one thing.
Do you know anything about
those old ruins? - No.
But why are you asking this?
- I don't know why.
I don't know why I feel..
..that I have a very old
relationship with those ruins.
Why had you gone there?
I just reached there while taking
a walk and.. - No, dear.
Don't go there!
That place isn't good.
But mother, I used to go there
when I was young too!
Who told you this?
- No.. no one told me mother..
..but I remember a little.
- Dear!
Forget all these things!
- But why?
Don't answer my questions
with a question!
I said so and that is all!
Go to sleep now.
I feel that some story of my past
is hidden in those ruins.
That girl was also saying
the same thing.
But I don't know why mother is
hiding all this from me!
It may be anything! I feel
like meeting that girl..
..again and again.
Young master, accept these flowers.
- These flowers!
No, not this plant!
Accept this valley's smallest
and the most beautiful gift!
Thank you, Mr. Munshi
- Mention not! - Mr. Munshi. - Yes?
Where do you stay?
In my house. You are new here.
The mountain that is on the
opposite side, in the lap..
..of those mountains, there
is a small village.
There is a small lake there.
And on the banks of that small lake..
..there is a temple.
- Yes. In that temple's lane..
..the house whose mirrors
are all broken, that is..
..my house.
- So that's where you stay!
Yes, I stay there.
Mr. Munshi, tell me one thing.
- Yes, ask me.
The village where you stay, you must
know all your neighbors.
Yes, they know me. And I know them.
So you must also know her?
- Yes, I definitely know her.
But whom? - Her.. She stays in
your village. She's very..
Some other time!
- Who is this 'some other time'?
There's no one in my village by
the name of 'some other time!'
Young master!
- What is the matter, Mr. Munshi?
Engrossed in your
'some other time'..
..I forgot my present matter.
This Munshi's wife..
..has invited you to her house.
Invited me?
- Yes. - For what?
It's my death anniversary.
Death anniversary?
Yes. For the sake of saying it,
it's my marriage anniversary..
..but for me, it's an anniversary
of destruction!
The day I got married, I had
died that day itself!
From that day till today,
I've been hiding..
..my living corpse beneath
this English coat..
..and wandering about in the
lanes of the village!
Come on, Mr. Munshi. Don't
say such things!
By the way, when is your
marriage anniversary?
That inauspicious day
is tomorrow itself.
But if you come, that day will
become auspicious. - Me?
Yes. If you come, then
this poor man..
..will be respected more.
Many people will come.
You will be talked about. I will
have to spend more money.
More money would be spent,
but it will be fun.
Every person of the
village will come..
..man and woman, every unmarried
girl will come..
..all the lovely girls will come.
So even Rajni will
surely come there!
[Wedding Clarinet]
Hey Khushmizaz Khan!
Why are you playing this sad music..
..on this happy occasion?
- What do I do Mr. Munshi?
I will not get anything here.
Only the wrong notes will
be played free of cost.
I have come here after
leaving a marriage..
..where I would have
got 99 rupees!
Hey! You are trapped in
the circle of 99 rupees..
..and I want to send
you to America!
Mr. Munshi, what will happen there?
What will happen there?!
There will be a dollar,
a raised collar!
Have you heard of
Pundit Ravi Shankar?
Who doesn't know him?
He was sitting beside a lake
and playing the sitar.
I told the young master
and sent him to America.
Today, in the whole of America..
..it is his sitar that
is being played!
I want that, with this small
clarinet of yours..
..you sit on America's highest
building, the Empire Estate.
Can you imagine it?
- Yes.
And make the whole of America
hear your tune!
I want you to get down
from there, come here..
..and play the tune of happiness.
- Should I play?
Play!
Hey Mr. Munshi!
- Bhanumati!
Hey wrestler!
- What?
I mean my dear wife! Will
you eat all the sweets alone?
We have to feed the guests also.
Let the guests go to hell!
I have ordered these sweets
only for myself!
Oh daughter!
- Mother!
Mother? Who mother?
Mother.
- How are you?
I am fine.
- Has everyone come?
Yes. Many people have come.
Munshi dear. - Madhu has passed away.
- Hey, thin man!
I mean to say, that father-in-law,
your health has..
..improved.
- Madhu and Komal..
How are you?
- Move aside now.
Son Munshi, talk to
the young master..
..for any one of them.
- To the young master?
Yes. - You were saying that everyone
in the palace does as you say!
Yes, everyone does as I say.
So tell him about any of them.
I feel it's time for me to leave.
Young master!
Greetings! Come!
Hey! Stop playing this clarinet
without any reason!
Young master, please come here.
Meet my wife. Please come.
This is my wife!
- What nonsense are you talking?!
This is my mother-in-law.
This is my wife. No!
This is my wife.
- Greetings!
And all these are my wife's sisters.
I mean they are my sister-in-laws.
Fine. Greetings!
- All of them are single.
All are very sweet.
Seven friends are standing..
..and troubling me again and again.
Master.
- Yes.
Master, there are cars made
of iron at your place.
They drink petrol.
But they are like leeches.
They drink my blood!
- Drink your blood?! How is that?
Master, I have to bear their load..
..that is I have to pay
money for all of them!
Master, raise my salary.
What kind of a light was that?
Hey, a photograph!
Please one more!
Master won't come again and
again. Take a photo.
Listen!
- What happened? Tell me.
Click one photograph of mine
with him, please. - Why not?
Click the photograph! Click it!
Move aside! What will you do by
getting your photograph clicked?
[Muttering]
Move aside!
Click it!
Don't pull me!
Hey, are you getting your photo
clicked or are you wrestling?
Why are you hitting your head?
Are you clicking a photograph..
..or are you measuring the room?
You came all the way from there
till here! Click a photograph!
Hey! How do I take a photograph?
All of them are not
fitting in the frame.
So how do I click the photograph?
All of them fit in a room..
..and they are not fitting
in your camera frame!
The camera has clicked the
photograph of the moon.
How are they not fitting in this
camera frame? Let me see.
Bhanumati is fitting.
Hey! Is the whole frame of
the camera open? - Yes.
The whole frame is open.
- Then why are they not fitting?
They are not fitting at all!
- Mr. Munshi.
Yes.
- What kind of food does she eat..
..that she is growing so fat?
What did you say?
Take care of the camera!
What happened, you dwarf?!
You are standing on the stool..
..and looking at my daughters with
an evil intent! - No, mother!
Come here, mother's son.
- I hope he didn't die!
O God! Son of a mosquito!
Move off me!
He is raping me! Move
off me! Save me!
All this is going on for your
entertainment! - Yes.
Be careful, Bhanumati! This
is a man, not a football.
I hope he didn't break!
[Birds - Chirping]
Hey! Where is she?
[Laughing]
Hey! What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.
Me? - Yes. I knew that
you would surely..
..be at Mr. Munshi's place today!
Hey! Forget it! I had
not come for Mr. Munshi.
To tell you the truth,
I came for you.
You had told me this address only,
near that temple, isn't it?
Yes.
- Fine. The whole village..
..has gathered at Mr. Munshi's house.
Then why didn't you come?
How could I come without
any invitation?
And no one invites poor orphans
like us! - An orphan!
So does this mean that you don't
have anyone in this world?
There's only me and your
memories. That's all.
My memories!
- Anyway, let it be!
See what I have cooked and
brought for you. - What?
Pudding! Hey, how do you
know that I like pudding?
I know everything about what
you like and what you don't!
This is not a relationship of a day.
It's a relationship
of many lifetimes.
A relationship of many lifetimes!
Look, I hope you don't have..
..any misunderstanding
about me, do you?
That day as well, you said
something like this.
I wasn't able to sleep
the whole night.
I asked my mother and she
also changed the topic.
I cannot understand all this.
You will understand everything
slowly. Come.
Let us sit there.
What are you looking at?
- You don't know that..
..I had really wished to
sit with you like this!
I feel that I have
got you after ages.
Now I hope that you won't leave
me and go away, will you?
What are you saying?
This innocent face
has made me so restless..
..that all my life,
I will not let you out of my sight!
Promise?
- Promise.
[Chuckling]
"You have made me so restless."
"You have made me so restless."
"I have promised you that
I have become yours."
"My heart has made me so helpless."
"My heart has made me so helpless."
"I have promised you that
I have become yours."
"You have made me so restless."
"My heart has made me so helpless."
"I swear by you that I feel..
..that this is not our
first love, sweetheart."
"Oh my love! We have been
separated many a time."
"We decided to meet again."
"I have promised you that
I have become yours."
"You have made me so restless."
"I promise you that
I am yours."
"The night doesn't get over."
"The night doesn't get over.
The day doesn't get spent."
"When doesn't my heart
remember you?"
"I was not satisfied
by just waiting for you."
"I took this simple decision."
"I have promised you that
I have become yours."
"My heart has made me so helpless."
"I have promised you that
I have become yours."
"My love, you broke
the glass bangles."
"My love, you broke
the glass bangles."
"You broke all the promises
of shyness."
"You broke all the promises
of shyness!"
"You have already taken
away my sleep!"
"Why did you spare my life?"
"Your sight did half the work."

[Night Insect]
Mother, you have not slept as yet?
If you stay out of the house
in the middle of the night..
..how will I be able to sleep?
I'm sorry mother. I got late.
You have been told before
as well, Raju..
..that we have many enemies here!
You never know who is there
on the lookout at any time.
When will you understand?
Mother, I was with a friend..
..and we were lost in
talking to each other.
It has been just four days since
you have come back!
Which friend have you met..
..with whom you are roaming
till 1 o'clock?
There is a friend, mother.
You don't know that person.
Who is this person whom I don't
know, in this small place?
Let it be, mother please.
I am feeling very hungry.
Janardhan, get the food ready.
I will just freshen up and come.
By asking for Vijaya's
hand in marriage..
..for Rajeev, you
have really taken..
..the load off my chest!
Sister-in-law, you know
the big responsibility..
..that a father has of a daughter
whose mother is no more!
How can she be a daughter
without a mother?
I am her mother. - I am very
happy today, sister-in-law!
I'm very happy!
I don't know since how
many generations..
..our family has been
taking care of you!
Today, you have given
an opportunity..
..to get both families united.
Just order me! On which
auspicious day..
..should the marriage take place?
- As soon as possible.
The sooner Vijaya comes and takes..
..care of her household
responsibilities..
..the earlier will
I be relieved of my duties!
Along with Vijaya,
I want to hand over to Rajeev..
..all his rightful property.
I have spoken to the lawyer.
As soon as all the
papers are ready..
..by giving all the
property to Rajeev..
..I also want to be relieved
of my duties!
You know very well, sister-in-law,
that at that time..
..the circumstances
were such that..
..I had to transfer
the entire property..
..in my name because you
had ordered me to so!
But even then, I had signed
a document which said that..
..that in spite of
this legal action..
..Rajeev is still the sole
heir of this property.
Yes. Mr. Munshi was telling me.
But that document cannot be found..
..since a long time. God knows..
..whether it is hidden in some
files or if it is lost!
Well! Hey! It's so late and
the driver hasn't come yet.
Come, sister-in-law. I will
drop you home. - Fine.
Come.
May you live long. And
come to my house soon..
..like a daughter-in-law!
[Chuckling]
[Car Engine]
[Door Opens]
You here? Suddenly!
Mother left with father
a long time ago!
Mother has left?
- Yes.
I had come to pick her up.
Anyway, no problem! I will leave.
Very good! Today I won't let
you go away so easily.
Today is a very big
day in our lives.
I didn't understand anything!
- When you go home..
..mother will explain
everything to you.
Alright, what will you have?
Tea or coffee? - No. You..
Have something!
- What were you trying to say?
Mother has asked for my hand in
marriage from father! - What?
Yes. - How can this be possible,
Ms. Vijaya?
What?
- Look, don't misunderstand me!
You are educated and intelligent.
You know very well that
in today's world..
..marriages don't hold any meaning..
..if we don't know each other.
And truly speaking..
..I have never thought
about you that way!
Let's forget it, Mr. Rajeev!
I can understand what
you are saying.
Our elders forget that while
making decisions in life..
..it's not them but we who
have to spend our life.
Don't worry at all!
I will explain to father.
Thank you! By saying this, you have
relieved me. I'll leave now.
You are relieved, Mr. Rajeev.
But what about me?
How can you dare to refuse?
In spite of knowing
that everyone knows..
..that I have already fixed
your marriage with Vijaya?
You took a decision for my life,
without asking me, mother?
Till today, in our family, it
has always been the elders..
..who have taken decisions.
Don't I have this right over you?
You have a right, mother.
But some decisions are such
that they need to be taken..
..after a lot of thought!
I have fixed this marriage only
after giving it a lot of thought!
And can there be any girl
who is more beautiful..
..and cultured than Vijaya?
- There is a girl, mother.
Who is she?
- She stays in a village nearby.
What is her family like?
Who are her parents?
She has no one in
this world, mother.
You have forgotten the respect and
the pride of your ancestors..
..and you want to bring an
orphan into this house..
..as my daughter-in-law?
She will not remain an orphan..
..when she gets your motherly love.
Listen to this very carefully!
I have promised Ajay Singh.
And for me, a promise is more
valuable than my life.
As long as I am alive, if
you will get married..
..then it will only be to Vijaya!
This can never happen!
I will not let anyone
snatch away my right!
After waiting for so many years..
..I have got you.
If someone tries to snatch
away my happiness..
..I will not spare her!
I will not spare her.
Why are you getting so tensed?
Who is snatching away
your happiness?
You don't know how I have
spent these years..
..dying each moment
waiting for you..
..only with the hope that
I may meet you someday!
And that we would start
a new life! But..
But now that God has
heard my prayers..
..I don't know who has come
to snatch away my right!
No one can come between us, Rajni.
I just care about mother.
If I refuse, I wonder
how she will feel!
And don't you care about me?
Except you, I don't have
anyone in this world.
If I don't get you, then
I will commit suicide.
No, Rajni!
Rajni.
[Sobbing]
[Wall Clock]
Young master. Please eat.
It's already 11 o'clock.
Has mother eaten?
- No. She has refused to eat.
Mother! Mother, I know that
you are upset with me.
I have hurt you. But mother,
I can't hide anything from you.
I cannot live without Rajni, mother.
Before telling you this,
I thought a lot..
..about this house's limitations,
your feelings..
..and Ajay Singh getting hurt.
But I felt that if I suppressed
the voice of my heart..
..then I may either not
live or even if I did..
..then I would be a corpse!
- No, Raju!
Vijaya is the daughter
of an affluent father.
She will find any nice boy.
But Rajni is an orphan, mother.
She will die without me!
I request you to meet
Rajni just once!
After that, I will do
whatever you say!
Fine. Bring her some day.
What does he think of himself?
- Let it be, father.
Don't worry about me.
I have changed my way of thinking.
What does that mean?
- You know very well..
..that since the time I have
come from Shantiniketan..
..my teacher is calling
me there to learn music.
And I have also written to
him that I will come there.
How will you go like this?
- By going there..
..I want to forget everything.
- No!
It is impossible to forget
this bitter insult!
Where was this boy..
..when his mother, his property,
his riches..
..his land, everything was at
the mercy of the enemies?
Where was this boy at the time..
..when the government
had seized his factory?
His fields were bare! By working
hard day and night..
..I had supported them
in their bad times.
And today they have betrayed
me in such a big way!
Such a big treachery?! No!
I will not at all let this happen.
- But, father..
You just go inside, dear!
Mahavir Singh - Yes, master?
Mahavir Singh, find out who is that
girl who is trying to snatch away..
..my daughter's happiness!
Whoever it may be!
Just give me an order.
There is a lot of water
in the river these days.
I will tie up that girl's
hands and legs..
.and throw her in the water!
And she will flow so far away that..
..even when the corpse is found,
it would be miles away from here!

[Tire Screeching]
Come.
Mother!
Raju!
- Yes.
Where had you hidden
this beautiful girl?
Mr. Munshi, start the preparations
for the marriage.
This marriage will not
take place, Girja!
Tomorrow, in place of the bride's
marriage procession..
..dead bodies will be
carried to the palace.
That too, not one or two,
but altogether three!
And you people will do
this work. You people!
Did you understand?
- Yes, Mr. Thakur.
Everyone knows that even
now the enemies..
..have their eyes set on the palace.
At such a time, when you
attack that palace..
..dressed as dacoits, towards
the end of the marriage..
..people will think
that this attack..
..has happened for the money
and the jewelry.
The screams of the dying people
will get suppressed..
..by the music of the clarinets
played during the marriage.
And only then will I be at peace!
[Wedding Clarinet]
Wait!
- A snake!
[Gun Firing]
Fools! You are still here!
And the marriage ceremony
is already over!
Sir, how could we have come?
The snakes stopped us!
What nonsense are you talking?
- He is right, sir.
The snakes didn't let us
get out at all.
Where is Girja?
- A snake bit him.
His dead body is lying upstairs.
[Birds - Chirping]
May you be blessed,
daughter-in-law!
I don't know which good deeds
have I done in the past that..
..God fulfilled my wish
of having a daughter..
..as well as a daughter-in-law!
It was me who had done..
..a good deed, mother
because of which..
..I've got your love.
- Queen mother!
The breakfast has been served.
Hey! Mother is fasting today.
Mother, I had soaked
almonds at night.
I'll just go and keep
the milk ready.
Take some care of yourself too!
You don't know how precious
and lucky you are for me!
Hail the Lord!
Hey! Who is it?
Hail the Lord!
Sage, you! Greetings.
- May you live long!
After so many years, I've been
blessed by your presence!
I was on my way back
from the Kumbh fair.
I thought of meeting you on the way.
I hope that everything is fine.
- I have your blessings!
Please come. Please sit.
Hail..
What is the matter, Sage?
Why did you stop?
Mother, I feel that there
is something in this house.
What is it, Sage? - The presence
of some poisonous snake.
The presence of a poisonous snake?
But I have never seen it.
Sage, if you have felt the
presence, then it's only you..
..who can resolve this problem!
- Surely!
I will come back again
some other day..
..and I will take that
snake away from here.
Hail the Lord!!
[Crowd Chattering]
Sage, if you say, shall
we start preparing..
..to leave for Kooj?
No!
We must wait here now.
My divine sight is telling me..
..that what I have been
wandering in search of..
..since years, I will
get it here only.
Don't feel sad, father.
You.. You should think..
..that your daughter has yet
not completed her education!
Without becoming a parent..
..you will not understand
such things, dear.
How a child's sorrow makes
the parents suffer!
A father who had dreamt of getting
his daughter married..
..what he is going through while
sending her away to work.
No, father.
Working in Shantiniketan
is just an excuse.
And you know that I am
very attached to music.
By teaching others, in some time..
..I will totally immerse
myself in music. And..
And I will forget this
loneliness in my life.
[Sobbing]
Alright, father.
I swear on these tears, dear..
..that till I make the people
who have made you cry..
..shed tears of blood..
..Ajay Singh will not be at peace!
Mr. Thakur, here are the documents
of the property..
..which you had asked me to
get ready. Sign them please..
..and make Rajeev the heir
of his father's property.
No, I will not sign these papers.
But, uncle! Why did you
refuse all of a sudden?
The same way as you had
suddenly refused..
..to get married to my daughter!
This isn't fair.
Marriage and property
are two different issues.
And how can you refuse to give back
whatever is rightfully mine?
Whatever is rightfully yours?
- It's surely mine.
Fine. Prove it and take it!
Right now, it's me who
has the upper hand.
I didn't know that pretending
to be good..
..you could be such a traitor,
Ajay Singh!
You are talking only of the present!
Just wait and watch, young man.
If I don't throw you
out on the road.. - Ajay Singh!
Look Mr. Thakur,
there's no use fighting!
Just tell us whether you will
sign the papers or not!
No!
Son, Ajay Singh truly
has the upper hand now.
If you want to take back
all your property..
..then find that document signed
by Ajay Singh first!
Greetings Sage!
- May you live long!
I thank my lucky stars that
you have come to my house!
Would you like some water?
- No!
There's no need for that.
First I will complete the work
for which I have come.
[Snake Charmers Been]
What is all this drama going on?
Who are these people, mother?
Son, he is a very
accomplished Sage.
Bow at his feet!
Mother, is he your son?
Yes, Sage.
- And that girl?
She is my daughter-in-law.
- Destruction!
What does that mean? - This girl
isn't worthy of living in this house!
What nonsense are you talking?
Get out from this house!
And the next time, don't even
step into this house!
What are you doing?
- The world has progressed so much..
..and you still get trapped
by this impostor?
Sage, forgive him.
- Alright.
I'll go from here.
Now I won't come here. It will be
you people who will come to me!
Wait, mother!
- Aren't you ashamed?!
You have insulted such a big Sage!
You are worrying about the
insult of such imposters!
And here it has become
difficult for us..
..to save our own respect!
Do you know that..
..Ajay Singh has refused
to sign the papers?
He tore those papers and
threw them. - What!
And the file which can save
us from all the problems..
..I don't know where have
you people have lost it!
Mother also behaves strangely!
I don't know what kind of
people she calls home!
What happened to you?
- What? Nothing.
I'm just not feeling well.
- Hey!
Then why didn't you tell anyone?
I will call the doctor.
- No! There's no need for that.
But why are you tensed?
Our family members are
also strange, Rajni.
There was a file which had..
..all our property and
business documents.
I don't know where
have they lost it!
I searched the whole office!
Mr. Munshi must still be
searching that file!
Now I will have to search
the whole palace.
You will find that file
at your office only.
How can you say that?
[Chuckling]
I mean that since I have
come to this house..
..I have kept each and
everything myself.
I haven't seen any such file.
Search your office only!
Hey! I'm just coming from there.
I didn't get it, did I?
Go there once more because
I'm asking you. - For you?
Please go there.
- Fine.
It is the same file! But..
Mr. Thakur, Rajeev has
got that file. - What!
This means that the file will
now reach the lawyer. No!
That file must not reach
the lawyer in any way!
Never mind if we have to
kill Rajeev for that!
No! This cannot happen!
I must stop him from going out!
Is it possible for you not
to go out today? - Why?
You do know that I have a very
important appointment..
..with the lawyer.
- That can also be done tomorrow.
It's very important that the
file reaches today itself!
Then send Mr. Munshi.
Hey! This cannot be
done by that Munshi!
I want all the work to be
done in front of me.
And I want you to be in
front of me all day long.
So that's what you want!
- That's what I want!
Look darling, one must love
at the time of love..
..and work at the time of work!
There are no time limits for love.
It can be done anytime.
Look, today's weather
is so beautiful!
My love, when you are
in front of me..
..the weather is anyway
very beautiful!
Then please wait.
- Why such eagerness?
I will come back in the evening!
- I can't wait till then!
Look, I have a body ache!
Hearing you, even my body
has started aching!
But what do I do?
It's imperative that I go.
If I were to die, would you still go?
What are you saying?
- How do I explain it you?
Hey! Why are you getting upset?
I will be back in the evening. I am
just going to meet a lawyer now..
..and not to war! Foolish girl!
"Darling!"
"You are my darling
just for name sake."
"You won't be bothered even if I die!
Of what use would you be then?"
"You won't be bothered even if I die!
Of what use would you be then?"
"Darling!"
"You are my darling
just for name sake."
"You won't be bothered even if I die!
Of what use would you be then?"
"You won't be bothered even if I die!
Of what use would you be then?"
"The weather is lazy."
"The weather is lazy."
"In such a weather,
let us love each other a bit."
"You have broken my heart
in such a way..
..as if someone.."
"As if someone has broken
a glass into pieces."
"Darling!"
"You are my darling
just for name sake."
"You won't be bothered even if I die!
Of what use would you be then?"
"You won't be bothered even if I die!
Of what use would you be then?"
"A dew drop cannot alter a stone!"
"A dew drop cannot alter a stone!"
"This beauty is of no use."
"You are unaware!
What do you know..
..what reason.."
"What reason I have..
..to wait for you with
bated breath!"
"Darling!"
"You are my darling
just for name sake."
"You won't be bothered even if I die!
Of what use would you be then?"
"You won't be bothered even if I die!
Of what use would you be then?"
Creep!
[Car Engine Start]
Whom did you call a creep?
- I'm talking to you. Are you blind?!
You couldn't see such a big jeep!
You would have killed me.
- I will kill you now also.
[Gun Shot]
Wait or I'll shoot you!
Give the file to me!
Doctor.
- There is no danger now.
But he has lost a lot of blood.
We are giving him blood.
He can go back home
in a week or 10 days.
He will not return home alive!
He is a very big obstacle in
the achievement of our goal!
And we will have to
remove this obstacle.
But Sage, how can this be done?
The king cobra will do this work.
King cobra, in so many years..
..I have never troubled you.
But today you will have
to do this work for me.
So that what I've come
here in search of..
..I can get it.
Hail, king cobra!
Hail, king cobra!
Hail, king cobra!
No!
My meditation has been disturbed!
I feel that someone has
killed my king cobra.
But who has dared to fight
such a powerful snake..
..like king cobra?
- It was me!
You? - I have only killed
your snake, Bhairavnath.
You dare to come here
to tell me that!
I have come to tell you that
whoever wants to harm..
..my husband or my family,
he will also be..
..in the same state..
..as your king cobra!
Anyone who looks at my husband
with evil intent..
..I will gouge out
that person's eyes!
I will cut those hands which
go towards my husband!
Quiet! Don't forget that you
are an ordinary snake.
May be you have no idea
of my meditation.
I know that very well.
I used to respect you a lot..
..because you are such a big
sorcerer and a scholar.
But I have learnt today that
you are misusing your powers.
May be you don't know that there is
another power that is greater..
..than your power!
And that is the power of a wife.
The power of a devoted wife..
..which can topple the throne
of the God of death too!
A devoted wife? And you?
- Yes!
Now I am that family's
daughter-in-law.
Daughter-in-law! Family!
You have betrayed them
well, impostor.
You can cheat that family
and the world! But not me!
I will bring you to your real
form in front of that family..
..and carry you away in a box!
It's only time which will
decide that, Bhairavnath.
But before going, I want to
tell you another thing.
Even if you look at my husband..
..or at his family members, then
I will destroy your identity!
How are you feeling now?
Till the time you are with me..
..I cannot be harmed in any way.
Your love..
..soothes every sorrow
and pain of mine..
..like a medicine!
When I look at you,
sometimes I feel..
..that you are some Goddess,
having an intuitive spirit!
You know every moment what
is going to happen!
[Chuckling]
Fine. If I am a Goddess,
then you are my God.
You are all my strength and worship.
Don't change the topic!
I have felt this divine
power of yours..
..many a time.
When I didn't find the
file and I was sad..
..and I went there again
because you had said so..
..I found the file there as if it
had been there all the time!
And this time also.
You stopped me so much from
getting out of the house.
And look at its consequences!
Forget about whatever
has happened, ok!
Now close your eyes.
Do you remember. Rajni, when
we met for the first time..
..you had told me that our
relationship is very old?
After getting you, it feels
that truly our relationship..
..is ages old since various
lifetimes! - Yes.
Since various lifetimes. Sleep now!
The doctor has asked you to rest.
- Fine!
Hey, what are you doing?
That day, you weren't letting
me get out of the house.
Now I am in front of you and
you are going far away from me!
This isn't our bedroom,
but the hospital. - Yes.
The room belongs to the hospital,
but the bed is ours. - Quiet!
If you won't come to me now,
how will you come here..
..after nine months?!
- Leave me!
She ran away!
I have come to apologize..
..on behalf of my son, Sage!
He is still a child. He is innocent.
He is unaware of the favors
done by you for our family.
And since that time
he has returned..
..he has been surrounded by
some problem or the other!
This is nothing. It's going
to be worse than this!
What does that mean?
- From where did you pick up..
..this daughter-in-law?
- Pick up!
I got them married and brought
her home, Sage.
Does she have parents, siblings
or any relatives?
The poor thing is an orphan.
- Do you know anything..
..about her family background?
No.
- How can you know it?
I didn't understand, Sage.
She is not a woman. She is a snake!
My daughter-in-law, a snake?
How can this be possible?
- Why can't this be possible?
She is a snake with magical powers,
who has come into your house..
..as a daughter-in-law for
her own selfish needs.
A snake with magical powers?
- Yes.
A snake with magical
powers very rare.
After many years of meditation
it gets such a power..
..that it can take any form.
Your daughter-in-law..
..is such a snake
with magical powers. - No!
My daughter-in-law?
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
You will believe it. But after
you see it with your own eyes!
Keep an eye on your daughter-in-law.
Once in 24 hours, she will surely
turn into her real form.
Hey, what happened to mistress?!
Hey, what happened to mistress?!
Hey Janardhan! Look what
has happened to mistress!
What happened, mistress?
- Come. Let us take her inside.
You need not worry, Mr. Kumar.
I have given her the injection.
The fever will subside till morning.
By the way, I will come
back tomorrow. - Fine.
I will take it myself.
- Thank you.
Listen. Sleep in mother's
room tonight.
It would be better if she's
not alone. - Fine.
No!
Hey! What happened to mistress?
What happened?
- What happened! - Master.
Mother! What happened to Mother?
- I don't know. - Mother!
Son, daughter-in-law
isn't daughter-in-law!
Take care.
- Yes.
Rajni is sleeping, mother.
What has happened to you?
All of you go. Come.
I think you surely had a nightmare.
Now sleep peacefully.
Rajni is here only.
I won't put the lights off.
Good night.
Today you saw all that..
..which you shouldn't
have seen, mother!
You shouldn't have seen it!
And whatever you saw, is true.
That is my real form.
Don't get scared, mother.
Don't get scared!
I have come here to gain your
love and to give love..
..not to scare or harass anyone!
It's my bad luck..
..that the secret got
out suddenly today!
Yet I swear by my husband..
..that I have always meant
well for this house.
And till the time I am here..
..no can even look at this palace
with an evil intent!
I want to tell you one more thing.
If someday, something bad
befalls on this house..
..it will only be because
of that sorcerer!
Mother, I beg you and request you.
Never meet that sorcerer again!
And whatever you have seen,
keep it to yourself only.
If this secret comes out
and if because of that..
..this house faces any problem..
..then don't blame me!
You were right, Sage.
She is a snake.
I have only one son. If
anything happens to him..
..my family will cease to exist!
Sage, save my son
from that snake.
I would have brought her into
her real form that day itself..
..and I would have brought
her here, locked in a box!
But your son..
I will send him away.
- He won't go anywhere.
He is completely under the
spell of that snake!
I will do anything. I will send
my son away from the house.
Fine. I will come to your
house on the day..
..of the snake festival and
worship the king cobra.
And by turning her into
a snake in front of you..
..I will take her with me.
I also need that snake.
Come, mother. Come.
I had asked you not to go
to the sorcerer, hadn't I?
Mother! What are you doing?
- Forgive me, daughter-in-law.
Why are you making me a sinner
by touching my feet?
It's me who should be
touching your feet.
Daughter-in-law, leave my son.
- What are you saying?
How can I leave him?
He is my husband.
But how can this be possible?
He is a man and you..
Do you want to know?
I will tell you everything.
Driver!
Take the car towards the ruins.
Do you recognize this temple?
- Yes.
This is the temple of
our household deity.
It's due to his blessings
that Rajeev was born.
Then you also must be
remembering that..
..on the occasion of
his sixth birthday..
..you had come here for worship?
- Yes.
I remember everything.
[Chant]
Mother!
Hey! The child has been
bitten by a snake!
Hey! Whose child is this?
A snake bit him.
Come.
- Raju.
What happened to my son?
- A snake bit him.
No! This cannot happen!
- Raju!
Look, his lips have become so blue!
Someone, do something!
Save my child!
Raju.
- Dear, open your eyes.
Open your eyes, Raju.
If anything happens to my Raju..
..I will also keep crying
here till I die!
Hail the Lord! - Raju, my son.
- What happened?
Sage, a snake has bitten the child.
- Oh God!
[Crying]
Raju, open your eyes.
Sage, a snake has bitten my son.
- Wait, mother!
Let me look at him at least!
Save my son, Sage!
Did anyone see the
snake biting him?
Yes, Sage. I saw it.
It was a very big snake.
It has gone that way.
Mother, move a bit away.
Go!
Mother!
Raju, my son. My child!
This is a jewel-hooded snake.
- Hail the Sage!
Leave me! Leave me!
Hail the Sage!
Hail the Sage
Hail the Sage!
You got your son. But no one knows..
..that for saving him, I had
to pay such a big price.
You had to pay a price?
- Your son had died, mother.
But the powerful chants
of that sorcerer..
..took the life of my snake
and put it in your son!
And since then, I have taken
care of my dead snake..
..hoping that someday, your
son would come here..
..I would bite him and my snake
would come back to life.
And he came here one day.
In him lies the soul of my husband.
So I touched his feet.
Then I felt that it was
my heart's weakness.
So I tried to bite him
but he got saved.
In search of another opportunity,
I stuck on to his cart.
I reached your palace and there,
I saw the love between..
..a mother and son
for the first time.
I saw a mother's suffering.
I felt that if something
were to happen to him..
..then you also would
not be able to live!
I gave up the intention
of biting your son..
..but not of acquiring my husband!
I am a snake with magical powers.
I can take any form.
So I thought that instead
of snatching away..
..your son from you and
acquiring my husband..
..it is better that such a
solution must be found..
..so that your son remains with you
and I also, get my husband back.
So I met him in this form.
Don't get scared, mother.
Both these snakes are there
only for our protection.
In their presence..
..no can harm me or this snake.
I promise you that I will never
return into that form.
And I request you to never
go to that sorcerer again.
Because if our house
were to be ruined..
..it would only be because of him!
Mother? What happened?
Mother, Janardhan was saying..
..that you aren't feeling well.
- It's nothing dear.
I'm just a little tired.
- Where is Rajni?
Daughter-in-law has
gone to the temple.
Today is the snake festival,
isn't it?
Call her right now!
- She should have been with mother!
Son. - Yes. - The day after tomorrow
is your father's death anniversary.
The holy water of the Ganges
is needed for the prayers.
And it is a family tradition,
that only the son..
..brings the water of the Ganges.
- What is this, mother?
Firstly you aren't feeling well.
And then, it will take 24 hours..
..to go and come back.
And truly speaking, what
is the difference..
..between the water from the Ganges
and tap water these days?
Raju! Just because you're
educated abroad..
..does not mean that you can
forget your tradition!
Don't you even know that the prayers
on the father's death anniversary..
..is the son's right?
Since so many years, I have
been going there myself..
..and bringing the water
of the Ganges.
And I do it today as well.
- I'm sorry, mother.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
If you say so, I will go.
Just let Rajni come back..
- I will tell Rajni.
Fine. I'll leave.
Janardhan.
Hail the Lord!
Greetings, Sage!
I was waiting for you.
Now free us from this
Problem, Sage.
Don't worry, mother. I'm here now.
Everything will be fine.
For some time, all of
you go out from here.
Till I don't finish
my work, no one..
..should be seen around here!
Disciples! Start preparing
for the worship!
What have you done, mother?
What have you done?
[Snake Charmers Been]
I will surely die, Bhairavnath.
But I will also not
spare your life!
"I am your enemy, you are my enemy."
"I am a snake, you are
the snake charmer."
"I am a snake, you are
the snake charmer."
"I am your enemy, you are my enemy."
"I am a snake, you are
the snake charmer."
"I am a snake, you are
the snake charmer."
"Since many lifetimes,
we both are enemies."
"God will set everything right."
"I am your enemy, you are my enemy."
"I am a snake, you are
the snake charmer."
"I am a snake, you are
the snake charmer."
"Today I will surely take revenge."
"Don't tease me, otherwise
I will bite you."
"Today I will surely take revenge."
"Don't tease me, otherwise
I will bite you."
"Magic and black magic are my toys."
"You will not be able
to control me!"
"I am a snake, you are
the snake charmer."
"I am a snake, you are
the snake charmer."
"By playing your pipe.."
"By playing your pipe, you
are trying to lure me!"
"I won't come
under your control."
"I will not get lured!"
"A saint has come as a dacoit."
"I am a snake, you are
the snake charmer."
"I am a snake, you are
the snake charmer."
"My story is on everyone's lips."
"The one who I bite dies
very painfully!"
"My story is on everyone's lips."
"The one who I bite dies
very painfully!"
"Everyone will see this drama!"
"Let's see what happens now!"
"You will not see
tomorrow morning!"
"I am a snake, you are
the snake charmer."
"I am a snake, you are
the snake charmer."
"I am your enemy, you are my enemy."
"I am a snake, you are
the snake charmer."
"I am a snake, you are
the snake charmer."
"I am your enemy, you are my enemy."
"I am your enemy, you are my enemy."
"I am a snake, you are
the snake charmer."
"I am a snake, you are
the snake charmer."
You have come here again!
I had told you to..
- Get out of my way!
[Thunder]
Let go of me!
Why are you chasing me?
How have I harmed you?
- How can you even harm me?!
But if you don't listen to me,
I will surely ruin you.
What do you want from me?
Do you know that 18 years
ago, your snake..
..had bitten a child right here?
And I had saved him with my
knowledge of magic. - I know that.
And I also know that with the power
..of your chants, you had taken
away the life of my snake..
..and put in that child!
But you mustn't be knowing
that I know..
..that your snake was
a gem carrying snake.
I want to know where that gem is..
..which your snake had
hidden somewhere..
..before biting that child.
What will you do with that gemstone?
By getting it, I'll
be able to become..
..the most powerful man
in this universe!
I will control the whole world.
You are not destined to get
that gemstone, Bhairavnath!
You are an ordinary snake!
What do you know about my destiny?
I have meditated for 40 years.
And I have gained such power..
..that I can bring any snake
into my subjection.
Forget about your dream..
..of bringing me into subjection,
Bhairavnath!
Because my husband came
at the right time..
..and ruined your worship
and your evil intentions.
If you don't tell me where
that gemstone is..
..I will kill your husband!
As soon as he dies, your snake
will come back to life.
And then I will force him to
take me to that gemstone.
You! You aren't a saint
but a sinner..
..a mean person and an imposter!
You are duping the world
disguised as a saint!
Listen to one thing very carefully,
Bhairavnath!
If you harm my husband..
If you want to save
your husband's life..
..tell me where that gemstone is.
I will go away from here quietly.
And I will keep this secret
to myself forever..
..that you aren't a
woman but a snake!
Even if you tell it to the whole
world, I'm not worried!
After getting the gemstone, you
will kill thousands of people.
To save their lives, even if I
have to sacrifice my own life..
..it doesn't matter.
But I will never tell you the
location of the gemstone. Never!
You will have to tell me!
[Thwacking]
Rascal! Cheater! You're supposed
to be a saint and you hit a woman!
It's good that you came here
to die on your own!
You have made my work easier.
If you don't tell me where the snake
gem is, I'll kill your husband.
I had promised queen mother..
..that I will never let her
family get harmed in any way.
It's time for me to prove myself.
There is only one way to save
the heir of this family.
And that is to perform
his death ceremony.
Sage, what are you doing?
Mother!
[Groaning]
No!
Raju!
Mother! Open your eyes!
Mother!
What have you done?
This was my last hope of getting
to that gemstone! And you..
You must fear God, Bhairavnath!
It's not good for
a saint to do such deeds!
Before the power of a devoted
wife turns you into ashes..
..go away from here!
I will go away but only
after I kill you.
No!
[Temple Bells]
[Temple Bells]
Hail Lord Bhole Nath!
Take this, Bhairavnath. It will
help to remove the poison.
Eat it quickly, Bhairavnath.
You'll get saved.
You know that I was trying..
..to kill your husband and you.
And you still want to save my life!
It was not you Bhairavnath,
who wanted to kill us.
It was the demon of greed ..
..and pride that was within you,
which made you do this.
But I want to save that man..
..who is a very accomplished
and great saint.
I want you to live.
And I want you take
away the grief of..
.. the people with your
saintly powers.
Eat this!
It's too late now!
You were right.
I have misused my powers.
I must pay for it now.
Oh God! If you want
to grant me a boon..
..for my 40 year old meditation..
..I would only ask you..
..to free Rajni from this
birth of a snake!
So that she can live with her
husband happily ever after!
That is all I pray for!
And for your blessings!
Hail, Lord Bhole Nath.
Hail, Lord Bhole Nath.
Mother!
