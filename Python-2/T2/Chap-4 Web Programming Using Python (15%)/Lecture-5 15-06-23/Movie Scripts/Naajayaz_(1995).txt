Yes, it's Raj Solanki.
It's me.
Naina.
Naina?
Yes, Naina.
25 years ago.
- Naina! -Remember?
Yes.
Naina, where are you?
How are you? Where are you calling from?
Listen, I'm calling you not because I want to be with you again.
But I have something important to tell you. We need to meet.






Yes, yes, Naina.I could meet you right now.
No, not now.
- Can you meet me tomorrow? -Yes, where?
Hotel Hilltop.
I'll be waiting for you.
What's wrong? Is it...
Look, I'll tell you everything tomorrow.
You will come, won't you?
Yes, Naina, I will come for sure.
Who was that?
- David.-What did he say?
Nothing.
Nothing...
My goods have been seized at the airport.






Do you need to go?
No, not now.
In the morning.
Does it still hurt?
You will pay a heavy price
if you mess with Pascal!
If you want to live here...
eat here...
make money here...
or even sleep on the street...
then you have to pay me.
Give me my money!
Yes.
We have earned seven rupees.
God's grace!
It's a big city, I'll survive here.
You're worried for no reason, dear.
So what if our villageis struck by famine?
God is very generous to us.
What is this? Why did you ruin the road?
Do you think it's your private property?
Remove it.
Don't step on it!
He's our Lord.
I'm the Lord and master of this place.
Understood?
Before you serve the offering to the Lord,
you have to serve me the offerings.
- Bring her to me!-Excuse me, mister!
Excuse me, mister!
If you call yourself a man, then talk to men.
Why are you dragging her into this?
Wow!
Look at this fool spouting off at me!
Spouting off in front of me!
Chotya, cut off his tongueand give it to him.
Let go!
Leave me!
Brother!
- Raj!-Ratan.
Doctor?
Please forgive me.
- How did this happen?-Keep quiet.
Quiet! Quiet! Don't you dare cry again!
We won't weep bucketsin this city. Understood?
No! No! No!
- So you were complaining about me.-Leave me!
Take your clothes off. Come on.
No!
Leave me! Leave me!
Pascal!
You scoundrel!
I won't spare you!
You abused my helplessness!
How dare you rip my brother's tongue out!
How dare you rip my brother's tongue out!
I will kill you!
Careful. Careful. Run.
Not here. Over there. Over there.
- Naina.-Yes.
Do you think we could meet again?
I don't know.
We'll meet if we're destined to.
Come on, now run! Run!
Naina.
Naina.
Where have you been?
Where did you go?
It's been years.
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you everything.
Who is he?
Look closely.
I don't recognize him.
How will you recognize him?
You haven't even seen him.
He's 25 now.
What?
Is he my son?
Why didn't you tell me before?
What would I have said?
He's your illegitimate son, please accept him?
I had been to your home several times.
Back then you were on the run.
I met your wife.
I saw your son.
So I made a decision straightaway.
My son and I won't taint your happiness.
So I went away
and raised him myself.
Where is he?
Naina, where is he?
Can I meet him?
Even if I try, I can'tstop you from meeting him.
This is what I'm afraid of the most.
What do you mean?
Twenty-five years later,I'm here to tell you
that he's a cop.
He has been transferredto Mumbai recently.
Well...
I can understand what you're saying.
He's a cop and I'm from the underworld.
But he's my son, right?
- Can I meet him?-No!
Swear on your kids
it will be our secret to the grave.
I kept it a secret for 25 years.
Look.
It's necessary to lie sometimesto keep relations alive.
What have you named my son?
Jay.
Jay.
Please go to the Hilltop.
Some kids are in danger.
- Help us.-Help us.
What will happen now?
Save us...
Sir, you have to hurry.
Now it's very difficult to deal with him.
We need some more time.
We are trying our best.
I have had a word with the headquarters.
We have informed them about your demands.
So I beg you not to do anything rash.
Make sure the kids don't get hurt.
We're trying our best to free your men.
I have given you enough time.
I'm warning you for the last time.
Bring my five men over here in an hour
or else I will kill all 30 kids.
I don't have powerto fulfill your demands.
I have spoken with the headquarters.
They will send a reply soon.
Give me some more time. Please.
Thirty kids' livesare hanging in the balance.
Stop this nonsense, idiot!
I've had enough of your rubbish
and I'm afraid I'm losing my grip.
I have spoken with the headquarters.
They will send a reply soon.
I need some more time. Please believe me.
Jay Bakshi?
So, one more cop is here.
You scoundrel. Have youbrought me some good news?
Or are you also here to negotiate?
Jay, patience is a virtue.
If we shoot,
the bus will plunge over the cliff
and we'll be held responsiblefor the death of these 30 kids.
I don't deal with such people.
I always make a decision.
No, Jay!
Jay!
- What's the matter?-Commissioner is here to meet you.
Here he is.
- Please have a seat.-What brings you here?
Yes.
Jay, sometimes life gives us opportunities
where we need to breakall the customs and traditions.
I have such an opportunity.
For the first time,
the government is givingan officer the option
to choose what he likes.
Take this. We are here to ask you.
Tell us, which service do you like?
Sir, please give me a minute.
Yes, sure.
- Mom.-Yes?
- Pick one.-What is this?
Just pick one.
OK.
What is this?
I have been given the optionto go to Mizoram...
- Yes?-or to fight with the underworld.
So what have you decided?
Mom, it's you who has decided.
I will live in Mumbai now.
From this day, Raj Solanki'sdownfall has begun.
Deepak Solanki.
Raj Solanki's son.
Sir, I want him to be my next target.
Why?
Because he's Raj Solanki's raw nerve.
Once we nab him, Raj Solankiwould come to his rescue.
What's your plan?
Abhi is the special clientof Deepak's extortion racket.
Abhimanyu Thadani.
He's a philanderer.
He molests women.
Sir, if we get him,
then we can nab Deepak and Chiku.
Listen, I'll call you later.
- What's your name?-Sandhya.
Write it down.
Write it down. Your address.
Come on, write it down.
And write down the reason for stealing.
Come on. Write it.
Sir, please forgive me...
Please forgive me.Please don't call the cops.
I committed a mistake. Please forgive me.
A mere mention of cops freaks you out.
What will happen to youwhen they would punish you?
Please find some other way, sir.
I have an idea.
- But...-What?
We can't discuss it over here.
Let's do this.
Meet me in room number 100f the Juhu hotel at 7 p.m.
You will meet me, right?
Sir, I...
Come in.
Are you scared?
No.
- No!-Are you scared?
- No...-Don't be scared.
You stole, right? So you'll be punished for this crime.
- No...-How can I let you go?
Why are you laughing?
Shall I tell you the reason?
You witch!
We're meeting under strangecircumstances, aren't we?
Thanks a lot, Sandhya.
Had you come a bit later, I would've been in trouble.
I wonder what he'd have done.
What he could have done?
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?-Please leave.
Come on, call your godfather.
Yes, slowly, slowly.
Now we have to...
Press it. Press it.
Yes? Wait, wait, wait.
- What is it, uncle?-Phone. Phone.
- What?-Phone.
OK.
I'll take it. Hang up.
- Hello?-It's me Abhi. Abhimanyu!
They have arrested me.
They have thrown me in the lockup.
They aren't letting me go.
They want me to give a statement against Solanki.
It's Abhimanyu from the police station.
Why do I pay you money?
Please get me out of here.
Ask him who's the inspector in charge.
Scare him.
Just tell him about your fatherand he'll release him.
Why are you crying like a baby?
Who's the inspector in charge?
Put him on the phone.
Take this!
- Hello?-Inspector!
You swine!
This is Deepraj, Jodhraj Solanki's son.
Jodhraj is your lord.
The one who you have arrestedis my friend!
Release him. Release him!
Look, mister.
Keep swearing and I swear, I won't stop bashing your pal.
He's bashing him.
Inspector, what's your problem?
Look, I'm calling from Jodhraj Solanki's house.
We can create a lot of problems for you.
So, just release our man.
Stop it, buddy.
Stop it, buddy!
What's the name of that inspector?
Jay Bakshi.
We'll have him released. Don't worry.
- Really?-Finish the drink.
- Finish it. Take this.-Yes.
We'll get him released.
Rascal, what do you thinkof yourself? You scoundrel!
Rascal! He braggedthat he'd bring in film stars.
Madhuri Dixit will come.
- Rascal...-Hey, what's going on?
- Why are you fighting?-Sir.
- Please tell them.-Hold it.
- Give it to me.-What should I do?
- They said they'd come.-What happened?
They'll dance during Ganesh festival.
- But they didn't come!-Who?
Don't listen to him, sir.He's very cunning!
You're just four feet above the ground
but when I kick you, you'd be...
What did you do with our money?
Did you lend it to yourgirlfriend from Chinchpokli?
- I'm so unfortunate to marry him.-Don't worry.
- I am so unlucky...-OK, OK, OK.
You want some entertainment?
Yes!
- You want to see some acting?-Yes!
- And you want a heroine to act?-Yes!
So what's the problem?
- We have a heroine.-Where?
Here she is.
She sings and dances very well.
OK, OK. I'll become the heroine.
But I have one condition.You should become the hero.

Your success must've wreakedhavoc in the underworld.
Is Deepak here? Deepak?
Deepak! Deepak!
Ratan, bring him downstairs.
- What?-Stay there.
Fool!
What did you do?
Why did you go with him?
What if you had been harmed?
Come here. Come here!
What did I do? I didn't do anything.
I just did what you did.
Anyway, I have to handleall this someday, right?
- Look...-Deepak is right, sir.
- He has to handle...-Yes, yes, David!
I know you gave him this advice.
That's why I don't likeyour friendship with him.
How many times I have told you, idiot?
Don't listen to everything he says.
Use your brain sometimes.
I wonder what revengehe is seeking from me.
What did I do wrong to you?
He introduced himto liquor at the age of 14.
I gave him a Mercedes car.
Crashed it. It was a narrow escape!
What do you want, David?
Do you want to kill him?
What are you saying, sir?
You think I will seek revenge on you?
You think I will kill him?
He's like a younger brother to me.
I have always been loyalto you since my childhood.
I may make mistakes, but I couldn't betray you.
- You're like a father to me.-Enough.
- Enough, David!-You've raised me.
Enough of this drama.Get out of here.
Go away!
Look, no army can have two commanders.
If there are two, then one has to die.
- Understood?-Yes.
- I will command here.-Yes.
Now get lost.
Uncle, he is...
Why did you scold me?
- And in front of him...-Why shouldn't I?
I must've warned you so many times.
You can go to America, London.You can go anywhere.
Earn some respect.
Become a doctor. Become an engineer.
Why? Why should I become an engineer?
Why? Uncle, tell me.
A doctor's son becomes a doctor.
A cobbler's son becomes a cobbler.
So, if I want to be like my dad, what's wrong...
Would any thief ever wanthis son to become a thief?
Would any alcoholic want his sonto die an alcoholic?
You're a bonehead! You're a bonehead!
Go upstairs. Go to sleep.
- Tell him.-That swine David is leading you astray.
- Listen to me! If...-You're mistaken.
- Dad, you're mistaken.-That's it. Go.
He isn't misleading me. I'm grown up now.
I can make my own decisions.
I don't understand what I should do.
Did you see that, Mom?
He scolds me as ifI'm a four-year-old kid.
He scolded me in front ofChiku and everyone.
I'll go away from here.
If he scolds me again,
I'll kill myself, Mom. I'll kill myself.
I don't know what to do!
Had it been my problem,I'd have handled it.
But who will explain it to them?
My blood will shed from both sides.
It will be my death from both sides.
We're here.
OK, so shall I leave?
Yes, bye-bye.
- You're so shameless.-What?
Aren't you going to offer me a cup of tea?
This tea is a very dangerous thing.
- Dangerous?-Yes.
You see, you'll come insidefor a cup of tea,
then you'll praise my tea.You'll ask for few more cups.
Then you'll start to chat me up.
You'll ask to spend more time with me.
Then you'll cast a glance at meand I... What else could I do?
I would cast a glance back.
Then you'd start coming here every day.
You will fall in love with me.
In the end, you'd propose to marry me.
And poor, lonely me.I might even get ready.
Then the same age old story will begin.
Quarrels, kids, fights, etc.
What's the root cause of all the problems?
Tea!
So I suggest to you, Jay Bakshi,
this tea is a very dangerous thing.
- Dangerous.-Yes. Tea!
Tea...
Jay, it's your photo.
What did you do now?
Ajay hasn't come back yet.
Naina, listen. It's me.
- You?-Yes, yes, yes.
I know I'm breaking my promise.But it's really important.
What's the matter?
I heard Jay's being awarded a gold medal.
It's in the papers.
Naina, don't you feel proudof our son's victory?
In our victory? It's everyone's victory.
Hello? Hello, you're listening, aren't you?
Yes, yes, yes.
Naina, I'm having a strong urgeto meet him today.
I want to see him. I want to pat his head.
Yes.
No, Naina. I'm going to meet him today.
I want to see him, no matter what happens.
Naina, can I come meet him? Hello?
Mom. Mom. Look at this.
Congratulations.
What's this, Mom? I rushed hometo tell you this news,
but you already know it.
Who told you about this?
My heart.
A mother's heart knows everything.
Her son's joy and sorrows.
It knows everything.
Dear Lord, you didn't give me the right to bring up this son
but I can at least pray for him.
May he always be victorious, Lord.

These kids...
Why do they grow up?
Be like your brother.
Deepak.
Be like your brother.
Jay Bakshi was born on the streets of Mumbai.
His mother used to sell knives.
We don't have any information about his father.
Jay Bakshi started off his schooling in Delhi.
We don't have any information about his father.
You are on the prowl
as if you're spying on cops.
It is you who is spyingon the cops, Miss Sandhya.
I spy only on the spies.
What progress have you madein Jay Bakshi's case?
Good progress, sir.
But I haven't arrivedat any conclusion, sir.
- Sir, here it is.-Yes, thank you.
- I'll submit the reports soon.-OK.
I just need some more time.
I'm giving you the time, but with a warning to go along.
- A warning, sir?-A warning!
The atmosphere is so pleasant.
Both of us are here.
- Mom! Mom!-What?
Pass me the towel.
- Please pass me the towel.-OK, wait.
Mom, please bring me the towel.It's too cold.
Mom!
Mom! Hurry up!
Mom...
- Mom!-What happened?
- What happened?-Towel.
- Towel?-Your son. Towel!
Oh, towel. OK. But who are you?
- I'm Sandhya.-Sandhya?
Inspector Sandhya Mukherjee.
- I work with Jay.-OK. Please have a seat.
- Would you like some tea?-Yes.
Impossible. It's impossible.
- What's impossible?-Marriage.
- Marriage?-I thought it was possible to marry him.
But a man who can't takehis towel to the bathroom...
how can I ruin my life by marrying him?
He's well known.
He has won medals and praises.
But back home, it's
"Mom, please give me the towel.Mom, hurry up. Mom!"
Look, Sandhya, every manbehaves like a kid at home,
always needing his mother.
I think that he looks for his mother
in the woman he wants to marry.
Was Jay's father like this?
Yes.
He was strict but soft-hearted.
What's the matter? I don't see any of his pictures here.
You put up pictures of peoplewho go away from you.
What's the point in putting up pictures
if they are close to the heart?
Right.
You're right.
Mom, I have taken a thousand rupees
to get sweets for my friends.
- I'll be out late.-OK.
- Let's go, Sandhya.-Let's go, towel master.
Hail Lord Rama Hail Lord Rama
Hail Lord Rama Hail Lord Rama
Hail Lord Krishna Hail Lord Krishna
Hail Lord Krishna
- Sweets. Charlie-Yes.
- Distribute it.-Sweets!
Take this.
Congratulations, sir.
Congratulations, sir.
Congratulations, sir.
Congratulations, sir.
- Rakesh, where's that cheapo?-Take this.
- Hello?-So, lady cop, do you recognize me?
This is your Romeo, Abhimanyu, speaking.
You couldn't harm me, could you?
Listen, you smarty, if I see you again,
I'll put you to shame in public.
If I don't ruin your reputation in public,
then I'll die of shame.
By the way, where are you these days?
Are you still working with that inspector?
My dear Juliet, try and understand.
That inspector is broke.
Hail Lord Krishna
Come to me.I'll take you on a trip to heaven.
- Hail Lord. -Keep talking.
Come to me, dear.
Wow! That's something great.
By the way, tell me something.Did you give birth in a gutter?
- What did you say?-The gutter at Worli?
You like gutters, don't you?
I'll take you to the gutterand then I'll...
Hey, do you want to die?
You'll put me to shame in public?
You'll take me to the gutter?
- You'll strip me!-Please spare me.
Let go.
Will you tell me something, Jay?
What?
Tell me honestly.
If you lie, you'll have toeat humble pie.
- Why did you bash that man so hard?-Why did I?
I know you'll say becauseyou're a cop and he's a criminal,
and because he tried toinsult a lady officer
he deserved a punishment.
But you know
and I know
it's something else.
So, what is it?
I have an idea.
Keep swaying on the swing
and you'll get your answer by morning.
Do you love me
Are you really crazy for me
Yes I swear I swear again
I swear and I swear And I will go on like this
My beloved, I love you since eternity
Do you love me
Have you been wanting to be with me
Yes I swear I swear again
I swear and I swear And I will go on like this
My beloved I love you since eternity
What it is to lose your heart to someone
How is it that you know the secret
Pretty woman you're too naive In the ways of the world
How is it that you learned To steal glances
How is it that a flower Learns to bloom
How is it that lovers learnt to meet
Sixteen seasons have taught me
How to steal glances
I learned to steal glances
Do you love me secretly
Do you wait for me
Yes I swear I swear again
I swear and I swear And I will go on like this
My beloved I wait for you every moment
Yes I swear I swear again
I swear and I swear And I will go on like this

My beloved I trust you At every moment of my life
Yes I swear I swear again
I swear and I swear And I will go on like this
My beloved, I love you since eternity
What's the matter? Why have you called me here?
What's going on?
Are you a cop or a ruffian?
Will you kill him for your enmity?
A citizen's life?
The government hasn't been awarding you
to mistreat people?
What do you think of yourself?
Sir, he misbehaved with our lady officer.
He abused us. Sir, I bashed him but...
- But? But what?-I didn't bash him, sir.
Are you saying I've donethis to myself deliberately?
- You think I've lost my mind?-Shut up!
- Sit down!-Mr. Jagpal.
He won't be charged with anything.
In return, you will
withdraw all the cases againstthe police department, right?
- Right, sir.-Right!
No, sir!
Sir, suspend me if you want to, but don't release him!
He's a scoundrel.
If you let him go, he could be a threat to women.
He's Raj Solanki's close associate.Don't release him, sir.
Hey inspector. You werebragging a lot, weren't you?
Did you see the result? Your police department,
your government,
all of them are in my pocket. Here. Here.
You were bragging a lot, weren't you?
Look at your status! Look at your status!
And you, don't messwith me again. Understood?
Rascal!
He was messing with us.
So I taught him a lesson, didn't I?
He's talking about status.
Have you seen your status?
Living off your father's money.
Try to live on your own.
One more thing.
Our battle has just begun.
Wait and watch what happens next.
He's nothing but a scaredy-cat.
You touched his raw nerve, so he'll obviously shout.
Hey, come on, shout.Shout yourself hoarse.
- Both of you, listen to me carefully.-OK.
Tell this to your father.
I'll break the legs of your lackey
and will present it to you tonight.
Or I'd consider myselfas an illegitimate son.
Now watch all the thingsyou said against me
turning out to be true.
Here. Take care of him.
You came here, but you won't go back alive.
Deepak! What's going on?
Dad. Dad, this inspector...
He dared to do all this in our house.
Are you going to shoot him?
Are you going to shoot him?
Do you know how to shoot?
Do you know how to shoot? Do you want to learn it?
You incompetent mutt!
Didn't I tell younot to mess with the cops
for this scoundrel? Get out of here!
Don't show me your face again! Scoundrel! Swine!
Dear, I apologize to you on his behalf.
What they did was wrong!
It won't happen again.
OK?
Dad.
You slapped me
for that two-bit cop!
Why, Dad?
- Dear...-Why?
Sandhya, I don't get this.
Why did Raj Solanki slap his son?
The entire world is scared of Raj Solanki,
but he seemed to be very helpless today.
How will you fight the enemy
- if you sympathize with him?-Right.
Towel master...
- Even you're helpless.-Why?
You can't even eat the ice cream properly.
Look, Deepak, it's the last drink.
You don't understand it, Chiku.
Are you my brother or butcher?
My dad slapped me.
- Look, your dad is...-Yes.
- Is my master, too.-Yes.
- Sorry to say, he has grown old.-Hey, hey, Chiku!
He's hell-bent on becoming a noble man.
Buddy, all the young oneshave taken over the business.
You should also take over everything.
No. What will I do?
Look, the main problem is Jay Bakshi.
First of all, put out a contract on him.
- Get him killed!-Contract killer?
Do you see him?
He's my cousin. He just arrived from Goa.
No one knows him here in Mumbai.
He'll shoot him amongst the cops.
You just issue the order.Just issue the order.
Issue the order and he'll kill him.
Kill him!
Kill that two-bit officer!
- OK?-First class.
- You'll take care of it, won't you?-You're my brother.
Kill him!
No, uncle.
Why did you bring me home?
- You're back home.-Go upstairs.
You're here after two days.
So what?
You never did this before, dear.
He could've called and saidhe wouldn't eat as he was late.
You've never come to mein a drunken state before.
Before. Before. Before.Get your hands off me.
I have heard enough of this before!
A lot used to happen before.
You used to be the enemy of the cops.
You were ready to kill the cops
if they try to harmany of your loved ones.
You never hit me
for that two-bit cop. Leave me!
I'm not a kid anymore.
- Don't ask me questions!-Ratan.
Ratan! Let him speak.
Go on, dear.
Can I tell you a bitter truth, Dad?
Go on.
Your time is over.
Your time is over, Dad.
You've grown old now.
An old lion never hunts.
- Yes. Wait.-No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Let him speak. Go on.
Go on. Tell me whatever you want to say.
Come on.
You can tell more.
Dad.
I love you very much, Dad.
Dad.
I have managed everything.
Really?
- Yes.-What have you done?
- I've hired a contract killer.-What?
For whom? For whom?
- For whom?-For that...
For that two-bit, scoundrel cop!
Jay Bakshi! Yes.
You slapped me because of him.
For him!
You may go.
This way.
Naina, is Jay at home?
- No, why?-Where is he?
- He went out.-Where?
- To a function.-Which function? Where?
Friends, I will start the program.
Party's election and manifesto
should be considereda part of this process.
Now I'll release the manifesto.
I'm very happy with this.
Our country would be going a step further.
We are making effortsfor all-out progress.
And we have to decide
whether we want to progressor go backwards.
I have decided
while all the other countries progress,
we won't sit back.
I have accepted the challenges.
We'll begin to progress.
The latest technologyhas been introduced everywhere.
Some people suggestwe should not use the technology
like other countries.
I'm against this way of thinking.
I believe in truth and non-violence.
Thank you.
Jay!
Jay!
So you already knewhe was going to be attacked.
You knew the time.
I just want to knowhow you knew about this.
Dear, you know very wellthe line of work I am in.
- You think...-Sir, here's the report.
You're managing the city.
If so much as a leaf falls in the forest,
I'm the one who knows about it first.
- May I leave now?-Wait a minute, Mr. Solanki.
We just got a tip.
The attacker was yourhenchman David's nephew.
On the one hand, your man attacks us
and on the other hand, you save me in the nick of time.
I don't get this.
Dear, there are some things... Inspector Bakshi
we understand some thingsthrough the heart, not the mind.
Maybe you'll understand it someday.
Get one thing straight, Mr. Solanki.
If you think you did mea favor by saving me
and that I won't arrest you, then you're mistaken.
I will arrest you someday.
I know.
But you have to release me today.
As you know, there isn't any law
to punish peoplefor saving someone, right?
May I go now?
- Dad! What happened?-Get up.
Get up! Come here.
- Why?-Come here.
Why, Dad?
You want to handle my business, don't you?
You are not in your sensesand you want to manage my business.
- Come here.-What happened?
- Come here.-What happened, Dad? What...
Seek her blessings.
Seek her blessingsand pack up your things.
What is...
- You're leaving today.-No!
Now he will live in Singaporewith Mr. Velji.
No, Mom. I... I won't go anywhere.
I won't go!
- I won't go!-Do you know the consequences
of getting a cop killed?
Had I not got there in time, you'd be sent to hang.
- Look at him. He won't live here anymore.-No, Mom.
- Take him away.-Mom.
- Mom, please stop.-Take him away.
- Mom, don't let me go.-Come, sir. Please come.
- Mom, Mom. I won't go, Mom.-Deepak.
Mom, I won't... Mom, I won't go!
Mom! Mom! Mom!
Mom, please stop this.Please don't send me there.
Don't cry.
What's going on?
I'm so worried.
I can't understand anything.
What's going on?
I'm reaping what I sowed! That's it.

Madam, this is Rajendra Guptafrom the telephone exchange.
We have recorded some importantconversations
on Jay Bakshi's telephone.
It includes underworld donJodhraj Solanki's voice.
- Jodhraj Solanki?-Yes.
- Was he talking to Jay Bakshi?-No.
A woman answered his call.
Look, the inquiry is still going on.So I can't say anything.
Stop them!
Why don't you tell us, sir?
Why aren't you answering, sir?
Don't salute me. Just throw them out.
They are after my life.
Why did he save his life?
Sir, why did Solankisave Jay Bakshi's life?
How would I know? Am I God?
I know why Solanki saved Jay Bakshi.
Why?
Give me an hour, sir.
I'll submitall the reports to you in detail.
Sandhya?
Just one hour, sir.
Sandhya. Sandhya.
What's the matter? Aren't you happy seeing me here?
Jay, I just want you to go away from here.
What?
You're asking me to leave?
Why? What happened, Sandhya?
It's nothing, Jay.
But I don't want you to be here right now.
But Sandhya, what's the matter?
It's nothing, Jay!
Just leave me alone.
OK.
May I know the reasonyou want me to leave?
Jay...
I need to preparea background report about you.
Now!
Please don't weaken my resolveby staying here.
Report?
What kind of a report?
Jay.
Jay, I deceived you.
The authorities from the Internal Security
sent me to spy on you.
They wanted to know about yourfamily background and I...
May I know
the shocking truth about my lifethat even I don't know?
You hate criminals and can't stand crime,
but a criminal's blood runsthrough your veins.
He has sired you.
You're an illegitimate son
of Jodhraj Solanki, the underworld kingpin.
What?
Mom?
- Is it true, Mom?-What?
- Mom, is it true?-What?
Is it true, Mom?
You hid an important truthabout my life for so many years.
You've left me alone today, Mom.
Very lonely.
Raj, call for you.
Please have something. I'll be back.
Who is it?
Yes?
- Raj?-Yes?
He knows everything now.
Really?
What will happen now?
I'll be there in a few minutes, OK?
Naina, I'm coming there. Now.
Yes.
I hate myself.
Why? Why did I allow youto start this inquiry?
Why did you succeed in it?
Do you know once this report is out,
poor Jay Bakshi would be suspended?
Cruel! I have been cruel to him.
Sandhya.
I want you to keepthe secret about Jay Bakshi
between us for now.
He's going to be awarded a gold medal.
He will be praised.
Isn't it? Isn't it, Sandhya?
Sir, may I say something?
You're a good man.
Jay, when did you come?
See, I have brought some shirts for you.
We have the gold medal ceremonyfollowed by the party.
Which one would you like to wear?
Sandhya, can you do me a favor?
Please deliver this to IG.
What is this?
It's my resignation. Resignation.
Jay, you can't run away from this.
This agonizing truth isa part of you and your life.
It will follow you everywhere.
Jay, if you go away now
you won't be able to forgive yourself.
You'd go insane. You'd kill yourself.
Jay, you have to win this battleat any cost.
For your sake.
You don't have any other option.
I'll make you fall in love with me

You?
Why have you come here?
I have come to meet you, dear.
I want to hug you once.
I don't want to meet you. Please leave.
- Jay!-Stay out of it, Mom!
Mr. Raj Solanki, there's a wargoing on between us.
You presence here can put mein a lot of trouble.
Go. Please leave.
No!
Have you lost your mind?
Do you even know who you're talking to?
Who am I talking to?
What are you trying to say? That I'm talking to my father?
Do you know, Mom? I feel pent-up fury rising within me.
Because I hate this man!
His blood courses through my veins.
Even if I cut myselfinto pieces and shed my blood,
I'll be his own flesh and blood.
- Dear, we had some problems in the past...-No!
I don't want to hear your tale of woe.
I don't regret being an illegitimate son.
I'm the legitimate child of God.
He has given me everything.
The light, shade, ground, sky. Everything.
The only thing I didn't getis a birth certificate.
So please don't tell me your sob story.
I'm not here to justify myself, dear.
I don't want to bore youwith my tale of woe.
By God's grace, I have everything.
The only thing I wish is that my sons...
I want you both to uniteand live together with me.
I don't wish for anything else.Please come with me.
Dear, come with me.We can go wherever you want.
We can start our lifeanew in some other country.
I just want to livethe rest of my life in peace.
If you want, this dream of mine can come true.
What right do you have to ask this of me?
I won't let this dream of yours come true.
Because I hate people like you.
I can make my life a legitimateone by killing people like you.
Rascal! Who do you want to kill?
- Who do you want to kill? Your father?-Naina...
- Naina, Naina...-Get out of here. Get out!
Feels good.
Mom, it feels good
knowing that you love him more than me.
Ladies and gentlemen
and my colleagues.
It's a joyous occasion.
Inspector Jay Bakshi is going tobe rewarded today.
So on this occasion,
I congratulate him on your and my behalf.
I even want
Inspector Jay Bakshi to come upand say a few words to us.
IG and my dear friends.
This joyous occasiondoesn't need to be shrouded by lies.
ACP Mathur and Inspector Sandhya
are hiding the truth from all of you.
But Mr. Mathur...
the lie isolates us from our loved ones.
So the truth must be brought to light.
As per Inspector Sandhya's report
I, Inspector Jay Bakshi,
am an illegitimate son
of Raj Solanki, the underworld don.
- What?-He's Raj Solanki's son!
That's shocking!
Sir, no power on the earthcan change this reality.
Sandhya, you were right.
The world of crimewhich I want to destroy...
I have its blood running in my veins.
After knowing this truth,
you might want to take me off this case.
But let me declare to all of you
that I was determinedto destroy crime and I still am.
Sir.
I give you this for safekeeping.
I'll wear it on the day
I bring down Raj Solankiand his evil empire.
I know this mission has becomemore difficult for me.
As my enemy is my own father.
Sir, I have a request.
Please don't take me off this mission.
This is the only way
to turn an illegitimate lifeinto a legitimate one.
Please don't close that way.
Please just give me a chance
and I'll achieve my goal.
I promise you, sir.
Hello? Yes? Who is it?
Chiku, can you hear this voice?
The time is ticking.

Jay.
I want to ask you, how long will this go on?
Jay Bakshi shut all of my dens last night
and Mr. Raj just watched it happen.
Whereas it wasand still is his responsibility
to protect us from the cops.
When the rascal Jay Bakshiraided my clubs and dens...
Were you paralyzed then?
Friends, if it goes the same wayour business will shut down
and we'll be thrown out on the streets.
How will you be thrown out on the streets?
We've worked hard for each penny.
We've dodged bulletsto amass this fortune.
Will we let that two-bit coptake it away from us?
That's great!
There must be a reasonwhy he didn't take any action.
At least respect his age.
Uncle,
I have arranged everything.
Call Bob inside.
This is Bob.
I have called him from abroad, uncle.
We'll give him three millionon behalf of the syndicate.
He will kill Jay Bakshiby tomorrow evening.
I've killed a 7-year-old kidand an 80-year-old guy.
I have killed businessmen.I have killed leaders.
Killing that cop would be a cakewalk.
I'll finish him off by tomorrow evening.
Tomorrow Jay Bakshi will be finished off.
Jay Bakshi is my son!
He is my son!
If anyone tries to harm him,
I will bury him alive!
Had I fired two inches to the left,
he would have been dead.
Do you understand?
It's very easy in this cityto kill a lone honest cop.
Did you get it?
Girl,
do you want to see him alive?
Convince him toget a transfer to another city.
Don't mess with us.
He doesn't have any idea of my power.
I have seen a lot of things in my life.
I can't see his dead body.
- Jay, let's go.-Take him.
Hold on. Hold on!
You think you can scare me
just like you've beenscaring poor people...
- Jay...-Don't interfere, Sandhya!
Either this war will end your crimes
or it will end my life.
No one will get anythingout of your death, dear.
No one benefits.
A corrupt minister
will hand a medal to your weeping mother.
You'll be mentioned in theinside pages of a newspaper.
I'm your father, dear.
Dear, please agree.
I'm your father. Listen to me.Please go away from here.
Please go away from here. I beg you.
I beg you, dear. I beg you, dear.
- My love...-The word "love" doesn't suit you.
Do you know what love is?
My mom loved you!
She never demanded anything from you.
She raised me on her own.
If you love someone, learn to sacrifice.
Surrender yourself to the law
and leave the world of crime.
Can you do this?
No? I knew you wouldn't!
Do you know, Mr. Raj Solanki, when I'll be hurt the most?
When I'll be arresting you in a few hours.
Because my mother will be hurtthe most at that moment.
Even today, she loves youmore than her life.
You love me, don't you?
So save me from this dilemma.
But you won't do this.
Because I still haven't meta more self-centered man than you.
You were talking about love!
Is this a police stationor your private property?
Sir, I have got these papers.
It proves that the dens we raided
were not owned by Chiku, but Raj Solanki.
Call ACP immediately.
I want to arrest Raj Solanki right now.
But sir, at this hour...
These...
All of these...
These...
Are all these token of Jay's victory?
My son has always been victorious.
He's been victorious in everything.
And he might be losing today forthe first time because of me!
Because of his father!
I'm very selfish!
I'm a self-centered man! Yes, I am!
He is right.
He's absolutely right!
Naina, the hatred in his eyes for me...
My life will be fulfilled
if I'd be able to wipe offhis hatred even for a moment.
Dear.
What you said today was bitter...
It was bitter, but it's the truth.
Only a loved one
can say such bitter things.
Dear...
I called you as I...
I want to inform youthat I'm coming to you.
I just need twelve hours.
I have to take care of something.
After that, I will...
I will surrender myself to you.
Inspector, I'll surrender myselfto you at 9 in the morning.
Inspector Bakshi,
I just need twelve hours.
What happened, Jay?
Sir, now we might not need
an arrest warrant for Raj Solanki.
Why? Did that rascal die? Has someone shot him?
He just called.
He wants to surrender.
Jay, what do you think?
Your... I mean Raj Solanki
will surrender himself?
Sir, sometimes
we should trust someone, shouldn't we?
Yes.
It's your case, Jay.
You can do anything you want to do.
Radha, someone's here to meet you.
Please come.
Radha, this is Naina.
She will be your nurse.
Come in.
I'm going out for a few days, tomorrow.
I have some important work.
So I'll let her live with you.
She will take care of you.
I know who she is.
Get me vermilion.
Sandhya.
What's happening to me?
This man never did anything for me.
He didn't accept my mother as his wife.
Why...
Why do I suffer when I see him in pain?
He is your father.
Jaisalmer depot. Jaisalmer depot.
Please give me a ticket to Jaipur.
What is he doing in the other bus?
- We are running out of money.-Get down.
I'll give you more later.
- This bus goes to your village.-OK.
You go there.
- Take this ticket.-What?
And take this.
You will need it. Now go.
Forgive me.
Forgive me. Please forgive meif I said anything wrong.
Now go. Come on, get into the bus.
- Come on, get into the bus.-What?
Come on. I'm surrenderingmyself to Jay tomorrow.
You don't need to stay with me anymore.
Go back to your village.
You have done a lot for me.Listen to me... Go!
- I said go!-What?
- You have done a lot for me.-What did I do?
I don't want to put your lifein danger, brother.
- I don't want to...-Where will I go?
I have committed the sin, so I'll pay for it, brother.
Listen to me. Go.
- Get on the bus.-Where will I go?
- I said go!-I'm your brother!
- I'm your brother!-So what?
Now you won't listen to me? You won't listen to me?
- Brother...-Get into the bus. Come on!
- Brother...-Don't you dare get down!
It would be an evening Full of heavy moments
It would be a breathtaking night
It would be an evening Full of heavy moments
It would be a breathtaking night
How will this evening wane
How will this night elapse
The flames of emotions will be quenched
The flames of emotions will be quenched
Let me drink this flame of emotions too
Let me live as I'm alive now
Let me live
Let me drink in this heavy rain
What happened?
Jay?
What time is it?
Go to sleep, Jay.
The night hasn't passed yet.
Ratan?
Why didn't you go?
- No...-You came back again!
You came back again!
You came back again!
You won't leave me, will you?
You'll be at peace only if I shoot you.
Rascal, scoundrel, you won't leave me, will you?
He will die with me.
You will die with me, won't you?
Are you seeking revenge from me?
Madam!
Madam!
Madam!
- Madam?-What happened?
- Madam?-Radha?
What happened?
- What happened?-Deepu.
Deepu.
He isn't bad at heart.
He's very naive. Very naive.
No harm must come to him.
No harm must come to him.
It is your responsibility.
It is your responsibility.
Deepu. Deepu.
Deepu.
Now what?
I don't think he's coming.
It's all my fault.
I wanted to know if he loves me
and he'd leave everything for my sake.
Get the force ready.
We're going to arrest Raj Solanki now.
Stop! Stop!
Nobody will enter. Nobody will enter.
Nobody will enter. Stop! Stop!
Nobody will enter. Nobody will enter.
Jay, please.
Mom.
Mom.
Mom...
- Ratan.-Mom...
- Ratan.-Mom. She...
- Ratan.-Mom...
Let him come inside.
Come in.
Mom died.
Mom.
- Jay, I couldn't come...-Mr. Jodhraj Solanki.
You promised you'll surrender at 9.
- Yes, Jay, I promised...-I heard you never go against your words.
I think I heard it wrong.
Now I want you
to surrender yourself to uswithout any further problem.
Amazing, Jay!
Wonderful!
Didn't you even ask himwhy he couldn't show up?
There's a death in the family.
He lost his wife.
She was like a mother to you.
You have come to arrest your father, haven't you?
- That too, today?-Naina.
Are you satisfied with praises?
How many more medals do you want? Tell me how many?
Naina.
Had he died in my womb,
we wouldn't have witnessedthis unfortunate day.
You want to arrest him? So here you are.
- First, arrest me...-Naina. Naina...
Dear, please give me few hours.
I exchanged the seven vowswith that woman.
I spent thirty years of my life with her.
Let me perform her last rites.
I will wait for you outside.
Mom.
That rascal Jay Bakshihumiliated your father
and he didn't say a word.
What the hell have you been doing, Chiku?
Were you sleeping?
Your mom's last rites weren't even over
but that scoundrel Jay Bakshidragged your dad to jail.
I'll be there by the next flight.
OK. Be careful.
Jay Bakshi is very dangerous.He can do anything.
I'll be there by the next flight!
I'll meet you at the airport.
He's coming. He's coming.
Here comes our weapon!
Hey, these weaponsare not going to help us.
Now we'll use Deepak as our weapon.
We'll kill Deepakonce we get what we want.
As you have chosen me as the leader
so I have to do something for you.
We will win the battle against the cops!
We will win!
- Give me that.-OK.

Let me be clear.
I'll handle Deepak's case by myself.
No one will interfere.
Deepak.

to hold their fire? Why?

There are many others...
How many people will I explain this to?
How many people will I answer?
There's only one way to salvagethis department's reputation.
You are suspended.
Take off your badgeand your service revolver
and leave this place immediately.
This is my order!

It would be an evening Full of heavy moments
It would be a breathtaking night
It would be an evening Full of heavy moments
It would be a breathtaking night
How will this evening wane
How will this night elapse
The flames of emotions will be quenched
The flames of emotions will be quenched
Let me drink this flame of emotions too
Let me live as I'm alive now
Let me live
Let me drink in this heavy rain
In the season of rain
In the ambience of loneliness
In the season of rain
In the ambience of loneliness
I left home with a bottle
Let me live as I'm alive now
Let me live
Let me drink in this heavy rain
Let me live as I'm alive now
Let me live
Let me drink in this heavy rain
In the season of rain
In the ambience of loneliness
In the season of rain
In the ambience of loneliness
I left home with a bottle
Let me live as I'm alive now
Let me live
Let me drink in this heavy rain
Let me live as I'm alive now
Let me live
Let me drink in this heavy rain
