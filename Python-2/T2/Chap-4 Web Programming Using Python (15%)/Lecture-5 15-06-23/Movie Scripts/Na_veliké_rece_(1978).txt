Adventures of a little Stone Age hunter
Dolni Vestonice.
World renowned center of
Ice Age mammoth hunters.
So many relics,
so many still only lifted veils of mystery
about how people lived,
hunted or buried their dead.
The old woman buried
under the shoulder blade of a mammoth
was perhaps the revered 
medicine woman of the clan.
And this is her face.
It looks at us over the precipice
of the 25,000 years.
Women. The givers of life.
Mothers of humanity.






But of their lives
we only know
what is revealed by found jewelry.
What was the face of the woman 
who was adorned with these earrings?
And what was the fate of the man 
who was outlived by this weapon?
AT THE GREAT RIVER
Based on books by
Eduard Storch
Bring the bride.
I wish you happiness.
Clan of Ravens, 
I beg for your daughter, Squirrel.
Allow me to take her,
as a man takes a wife.
Welcome.
I accept your offer.
But the day ends with the sun.
Light a fire.
Greet our guests.






Move it!
Show your teeth!
I will give two sheep for her.
We accept your offer.
No! No!
Lets go!
- The day is not over yet!
Now eat and drink.
I gave two sheep. The best
woman does not cost as much!
Why wait?
Merchants!
My son will give you a cow.
I accept your offer.
Welcome.
Squirrel will be a good wife.
We wanted to give her to your Falcon,
but the traders brought a cow.
Hurry up. 
Hand it over.
How much longer will we wait?
Let's begin.
When the sun touches the ground.
You're going to give her 
to my son anyway.
Clan of Ravens!
Listen and judge with me!
The Clan of Falcons gives a ram.
You. Two sheep.
The merchant gives a cow.
Who offers the most...
- Me.
Two sheep are more than a cow!
Who offers the most.
He will take our daughter.
We give squirrel...
Wait!!
The sun hasn't gone down yet.
The day has ended.
Not yet.
Raven?
This is a scam!
The Clan of Falcons gives
a ram and a cow.
Squirrel is yours.
Mine!!
Let's go.
No!!
Wait.
I'll marry a woman whenever I want.
And I wouldn't give 
a cow's turd for her.
Squirrel.
Squirrel.
Squirrel!
Squirrel!
The raft disappeared 
and I found this by the river.
We gave a ram and a cow.
Go! And do not come
back without the woman.
Stay! 
Wait!
It's not your problem!
- It is.
Wait!
Do you hear me?
Falcon!
Watch out!
Wild-one?
Wild-one!
Wild-one is alive! Surviving the winter!
All alone!!
Where is he?
No one has ever managed to do that.
The best hunter of the Ravens has done it.
Not even the best hunter.
Catch!
Without a clan, everyone dies.
- I saw him!
Come on!
It was Wild-one.
- Paddle, we're wasting time.
Frightened, where are you?
Be quiet!
I am Falcon.
We're looking for merchants.
They must have passed
through here.
Offer a sacrifice.
And what will be left for us?
There is nothing to eat, Lapa.
He is not accustomed to waiting.
Do it!
Stop!
What are you afraid of?
- He's as big as a mountain.
He has a horn on his forehead.
When he walks, rocks fall.
And when he's angry, 
the forest burns.
There is no such animal.
He will kill us!
He will kill us all!
Come on!
The boat.
Search for the boat.
You asked about
the raft of merchants.
Why?
Was there a woman?
When did you see it?
At dawn.
Aren't you afraid to be alone 
by the river at night?
I'm scared, 
but someone has to fish.
Wait! I know a way that 
will save you half a day.
Which way?
Follow the Sun.
At the burnt tree,
go up the cliff.
There is a waterfall. 
And over the ridge you'll see the river.
Merchants sometimes stop there.
Go! I'll take care of the boat.
What is your name?
Happy Moment.
Why don't you believe them.
A beast can't set fire to a forest.
Big as a mountain
and on his forehead is a horn!
But...
He has left no tracks.
Watch out!!
Now do you believe?
Thief of women!
What do you want?
When the wolf steals sheep
from me, I kill it.
I am not a thief.
She came with me on her own.
- Your lying.
Falcon!
Watch out!
Stop!
Or I will kill him!
Let us leave.
And nothing will happen to him.
Drop it.
We will leave your son
in the village of fishermen.
Nothing could stop us.
Not even rapids.
The river broke my paddle.
We had to go ashore.
Then we heard something.
And you know who it was?
Wild-one!
Remember him?
The clan casted him out.
Are you listening to me? Wild-one!
Yes, I know.
Everyone said he would die 
without a clan.
But he is alive!
You're talking nonsense.
Did he give you gifts?
Give him some water.
It's heavy.
- It would make a deep wound.
How could they do that? 
From one piece?
It's not a stone.
- And what then?
I do not know.
I've never seen such
a sharp knife.
It's harder than bone.
You can sharpen it.
Stick it in.
What are you afraid of?
What if it breaks?
- Stick it in.
You understand?
- Yes.
What do you think?
This is the best knife
of the Grand River.
Lets go.
Come on.
Find the boat.
Go back.
You, too.
Squirrel!
Leave her.
I don't want such a woman.
Why are you casting her out?
She would never be mine.
You gave a ram and a cow.
One day I'll return them to the clan.
Get in!
Go.
Go home!
What more can we give?
We fish for you,
we bring grain,
we give honey.
We have nothing left.
What do you want?
Do you hear me?
I know what he wants.
Falcon!
I'm not leaving alone.
I will not scream.
Hear us mighty one!
We gave you our flock.
We fish for you.
We bring you grain and honey.
Now we give you a wife.
Promise us that you
will go away now.
Stop!
Let her go.
No.
Not yet.
I want to see him.
Falcon.
Falcon.
Let's go back.
This is not a beast.
Wait.
I am not afraid of you!
... afraid of you
... afraid of you
I am not afraid!
... afraid.
... afraid.
Look.
Wait here.
Watch out!
Wild-one?
It's Wild-one!
Ravenfeather.
Wild-one, where is the girl?
Do you hear me?
You will not find her.
You cast me out.
You thought I was going to die, 
I wouldn't last.
I do not need you.
I don't need anyone.
Happy Moment!
Happy Moment!
Boy...
never leave your clan...
alone.
Where is Happy Moment?
What have you done with her?
You can't get me.
I am Mighty!
Mighty!
Wild-one.
Lived like a wolf...
died like a wolf.
Happy Moment!
Thank you, mighty one.
Thank you for accepting.
Stop!
Don't be afraid!
The forest will no longer burn 
and rocks will no longer fall.
The sheep will remain on the pens 
and the fish in the nets.
He was not as big as a mountain.
He was not a beast,
but a man. Outcast.
To avoid dying, he stole.
He frightened you
and lived off your fear.
He is dead.
How can we believe you!
Prove it!
It's him.
It's him.
Wild-one.
Where is your wife?
I have no wife.
Take this.
It's a long journey.
Thank you.
What is your name?
Falcon. His name is Falcon.
Remember it.
