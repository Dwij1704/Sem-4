29.8, 30.3.
31.5, 31.9.
Let's go again.
29.7, 29.9.
30.4, 30.7.
Okay, guys, come on.
Let's keep the pace,
same stroke rate.
Another set.
28.7.
29.1 with a shitty touch.
Marie, come on!
31.5, 31.9.
Marie, this isn't about
your tan lines!






You're not on holiday here!
If you do another touch like that,
I'm sending you to the Quebec Games!
30.8, 31.2.
32.7, 33.8.
P-A, you're getting beaten
by a girl. Come on!
-How many left?
-Two.
All right Nadia, keep going.
Show him what you got.
Another set.
Simon Verreault for CRLS.
A question in French for you, Nadia.
What will you miss most
about being a professional athlete?
I'll think about that
tomorrow after my last race.
Thanks.
-Are you listening?
-Yes.






Your stroke rate was really good
up to the last ten metres.
You hit the wall wrong because
you came up too fast after the dive.
-What was my split time?
-You went out fast, 26.2.
That means the second 50 metres
were shit.
30.6.
-30.6!
-Okay, Nadia, what's done is done.
One last shot in the relay
tomorrow.
That depends
on the three other girls!
Enough with your attitude.
Okay?
I'll let you get changed.
Are you in control
of 25 percent of the race?
-Yes or no?
-Yes.
Don't worry about the others,
focus on your goal, okay?
What's my lactate level?
12.9.
Do a 1200-metre cool down.
Nadia.
Listen...
It's not what we wanted,
but it's done now.
Okay?
You have one last shot tomorrow,
so focus on it.
You can do it.
All right?
Go cool down,
I'll talk to you later.
Let's go, Nadia.
Your last one.
See you when it's over.
Fourth place now...
She's catching up!
Shots tonight, eh?
-Good job sweetie.
-Thanks.
You guys almost had me in tears!
Yeah, it was crazy.
And you!
Mission accomplished.
Thanks coach.
We'll be missing you at
practice.
If you ever want to come back
for the Worlds next year,
maybe we'll take you back.
Maybe.
Thanks.
Unless you put on 40 pounds.
Enough photos!
It's crazy, my parents are paying
a fortune to be here
but they have to wait till
we're home to see it.
Did you know at Athens,
one guy forgot his two gold medals
in his Village apartment?
Really?
I know you don't want to talk
about your retirement, but...
We're not drinking to my retirement,
but to our medal!
No. Seriously, bravo, and...
it won't be the same without you.
A little more.
And now the other eye.
A little darker right there.
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes!
I'd kill for lashes like yours.
Close them!
That's me!
Good changeover.
Good thing
you got a good start.
I like seeing that!
You get used to it.
But you really had
a good second 50 metres.
After the turn, I changed gears.
I even had my eyes closed.
-It's super frickin' close!
-I didn't know it was so close!
Look at your finish!
I was looking good in there!
I don't remember it like that.
Pass it to me after.
I've never been hangover.
That's what she says!
I've seen her in bad shape!
Not often, though.
Two tenths of a second!
I know, it was very close.
-Want one?
-No thanks.
Just a little one?
Give Nadia some chips!
No thanks!
With chips, it's disgusting!
-But you gotta do it!
-You gotta?
It's tonight or never.
-Are you ready for tonight?
-I think so. What about you?
-You have to check my eyes.
-You need some lipstick.
But I don't want one.
Who says that?
It's bullshit!
Pass it to Jess!
-Why Sydney?
-IÕve always wanted to see koalas!
-Koalas?
-Among other things.
-Can't you take two weeks off?
-No.
-I'm starting an anatomy course.
-You should take my example.
Tonight, I'm going to study anatomy
with a girl I swiped on Tinder.
She's Finnish or Swedish,
I'm not sure.
Scandinavian, in any case.
I'll be studying anatomy,
but it's a crash-course!
You'd like to study
Federica Pellegrini, eh?
Who's that?
She wins all the time, I swear.
Speaking of smokin' hot swimmers,
we saw a list.
Seriously?
Why do they do that kind of thing?
Where did they find
that photo?
Who cares about the photo,
you're on the list!
That's nuts,
I'd love to be on there!
We have fun,
we love each other.
Sure, you love each other...
You can only fuck when you don't
have practice the next day!
You know nothing!
Marriage in general is pretty
self-centered anyway.
Your retirement.
Okay.
First let's touch up your makeup.
I can't do it so well anymore.
Okay, here we go,
now I got it!
I think I got some on your teeth.
One foot in front of the other.
You can do it Nadia!
What's the point of high heels
if I can't even walk in them?
We're going to be surrounded
by tall dudes,
so you have to suffer
in silence, okay?
My ankles are too flexible,
I'm going to sprain one for sure.
Here. It's legal to drink
in the streets here.
-How do you open it?
-Unscrew it.
Hey! Sumimasen, bicycle!
You have to unscrew it a lot.
I think I've swum farther in my life
than I've swum.
What?
I mean, I've swum
farther than I've walked!
Well, tonight we're going
to make up for that! Get walking!
Hold on!
What's up?
What?
-Give me my cell.
-What for?
-I want to record it.
-Record what?
-Our steps.
-What?
Our steps.
-The sound of our steps together.
-Let's go!
We're going that way!
-Ready?
-Yes, I'm ready.
Hold on, wait for the light.
You're pulling on me!
Okay, ready?
Go!
At the same time!
Let's do shots!
I'll show you.
-I've already done them!
-No, these are different.
-You lick your hand like this.
-Which one?
Either one!
Then you put on some salt.
Then you take the lime
in the same hand.
Then you take your shot,
but you can't use your hands.
With your teeth?
You can use your teeth,
but get a good suction
going with your lips.
Go for it, I'll do it after you.
Oh, you're good at that!
My turn!
That's disgusting.
See?
We'll do it at the same time.
Ready? One, two, three, go!
We say, buonasera.
Good evening.
Nice to meet you.
-I heard you speaking French.
-Yes!
French people like wine, right?
Actually, I'm not French,
I'm Quebecoise. Canadian.
French Canadian. I know.
-So you don't like wine?
-Yes I do! Thanks.
You like the music here?
I'm mostly ignoring it,
to be honest.
-I'm a fencer.
-Oh, fencing!
Yes, fencing.
With the sabre.
-What?
-With the sabre.
-And you?
-Sorry, I have to take off these damn...
Sorry!
So... I'm a swimmer.
I do butterfly.
Butterfly?
It's more... like this.
One sec.
-I didn't know you guys spoke French.
-"You guys"?
You guys from the Middle East.
That's where you're from, right?
I'm Lebanese.
So the Near East.
And you also speak Arabic?
Yes, I speak Arabic,
French, English.
-Are you from Beirut?
-You know Beirut?
Well, like anyone else.
You'd be surprised.
If you ask an American
where Beirut is,
the answer could be anywhere
from Algeria to Mongolia!
So you're a Muslim?
It doesn't bother me
if you are or not!
Well, I wouldn't say it
quite so openly in my country,
but I consider myself an atheist.
My family is Christian.
I'm an atheist too.
Most people my age are atheist.
I mean, in Canada.
Cheers!
Hey Nad, bring your guy.
The Italians are bringing us
to an after-party.
Look what I found!
You want some?
No thanks.
I want some.
-What? Are you sure?
-Yeah.
Well... Come on!
I'll water it down.
Can they test us again
in the coming days?
Stop overthinking it!
How long does it last
in the blood?
For MDMA, it stays in the blood
and urine around three days,
but if you drink a lot of water and coffee,
you pee it out in 48 hours.
Ready?
Kanpai!
-Yes, I finally got you out of your head!
-Yuck, it tastes like bleach!
We need some music.
Put something on.
-Are we allowed?
-Of course!
It would piss me off if someone
did that at my place without asking.
Yeah, but that's just you.
I hope I didn't drag your speaker
around all night for nothing.
And I also carried around
the high heels that I bought you
because I'm such a good friend!
What should I put on?
-I know!
-What are you going to put on?
Tell your Italians
this one's for them.
-Why?
-Just tell them!
I'm not putting on "O Canada".
I don't sing.
If you want Canada,
I'll put on some Canada!
You have to sing with me.
-Will you sing with me?
-What are you putting on?
YouÕre such a baby!
Is there any Lebanese music
we could put on?
I dunno.
Any good Lebanese music?
Sure.
Quick, the song's ending.
Who is this?
It's Yasmine Hamdan.
An indie Lebanese singer.
What does it mean?
She sings, Enta fen.
Wel hob fen.
What does it mean?
It means where are you?
Where is love?
We don't have to do it
like that.
Like what?
And so?
Will you survive?
I just don't know how you do it.
I feel like such a slut.
What the fuck?
Don't do that to a swimmer!
First of all, you're not a swimmer
anymore, so I'm allowed.
Second of all, deal with it.
If you're a slut, I must be
the biggest whore in the Village.
-Here. Have this.
-I don't want it.
No, you need to eat.
No, I'm okay.
Not hungry.
How many calories do you think
are in sperm?
No, seriously.
Are there nutritional elements?
Maybe some protein?
Gross!
In Canada's Food Guide,
would it be more...
dairy or meat?
It's okay,
you don't smell too much like sex.
You do.
And so?
Looking forward to seeing Karen
and Jess this morning?
Come on, let's go!
Give me your bag.
Take your medals.
Okay, let's go.
Well, we wouldnÕt win bronze
this morning!
15 metres to go,
Marie-Pierre Nadeau is holding up!
Canada has not won a medal
in this event in 30 years, and...
They did it!
Bronze for Canada!
We're lucky to have these champions
in studio with us.
They've written
Canadian swimming history.
Here they are in order,
the opening backstroker, Karen,
Jess with the breaststroke,
Nadia who swam butterfly,
and the final swimmer,
Marie-Pierre on freestyle.
Bravo, ladies!
Thanks!
There was huge excitement
surrounding this race.
Were you very nervous?
I was extremely nervous!
I think we were all nervous,
but it was positive energy.
We swam well together at
the training camp before the games,
and we knew what we had to do
to succeed last night.
And we could see that!
I think people are very proud.
Jess told us that her phone
almost blew up with messages.
She said that this bronze felt like
a gold medal for the team.
For you, Nadia, we all knew
this was your last race.
I'm sure it was
an emotional moment for you.
Did that put additional pressure
on you?
Of course,
pressure was a factor in the race,
but I knew that I could swim fast,
and for once, I let myself
have a good time with the girls.
Your strategy must have worked.
You got the second fastest time
for butterfly in the race.
If it were an individual event,
that would mean a silver medal.
Does that motivate you
to stay and try for silver?
-Or gold?
-Of course, or gold.
We'll let you think that over.
And now Karen, you're the most
experienced swimmer on the team.
A medal is a soothing balm
for all the work done to get there.
Do you want to put in the energy
to make it to your fourth games,
four years from now?
I take it one season at a time.
My speed is still good,
but longer races are getting harder.
I might drop the 200-metre backstroke
to focus on the 100-metre.
We'll see...
Of course,
we'll keep an eye on that.
To succeed in a relay event,
it takes a lot of teamwork.
Marie-Pierre, tell us how you
managed to build that team spirit.
Well, I find it really great,
because I don't have any siblings,
so I think of these girls as my sisters.
Especially Nadia, we've trained
together for over 10 years.
We've lived through
all the highs and lows together.
And that's what it means
to be part of a team,
to help each other out.
It was great to see you
swim yesterday,
and as elite athletes, you've
dreamed of that Olympic medal.
Now it's around your necks.
How does it feel, Nadia?
It's still a little fuzzy for me.
I haven't had the chance
to celebrate with my parents yet.
But we really experienced it
together last night!
I see! Well, I hope you're able
to celebrate together again
while we look back at the moment
you received your medals.
Let me thank you
for coming into the studio,
and one more time,
congratulations!
As our coverage continues
with more live events--
Thanks so much, girls.
That was great.
Let me get your mic for you.
-Congratulations again.
-Thanks.
-Nad?
-Yeah.
We're ready to go.
Should we wait for you?
It's okay, don't wait.
You okay?
I'm fine, thanks.
But don't wait for me...
Okay, I'm going back to the Village
with Karen and Jess.
Are you sure you're all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Harder on the rhomboids, please.
-Got some stiffness there.
-Yup.
And I know I'm going to get
really good grades.
That's not what's stressing me out.
Okay, on your back.
It's having to go back to school
and feeling like an old lady
among all the 17-year-olds.
Jess is 17, you know.
There are a bunch of girls
on the team around that age.
Yeah, but it's not the same
in sports.
You can be lucky and go far
even when you're young.
You think you're here
just because you were lucky?
Not me.
No fucking way.
But take Jess, for example.
She hasn't lived
through anything yet.
She's just talented.
She has the right build,
she's tall.
But it sucks for those of us who
gave up everything to get here.
I like Jess, you know.
But let's say I have 10 years
of studies left.
I'll only be a doctor in my 30s.
That's a depressing thought.
Breathe in deep.
Seriously, just thinking about
jumping into a cold pool at 5 AM,
it's the worst feeling in the world.
I bet you'll end up missing it.
Not now.
Well, I saw you this morning.
Seems like you're missing it already.
It's like an ex.
Oh that's right,
you don't have a boyfriend.
I didn't want to go on the pill.
Why's that?
When Marie-Pierre started on it,
she put on some weight.
And as a swimmer, I had no time
for anyone in my life.
Roll onto your left side.
Thanks.
What I wanted to say
was when you end a relationship,
at first,
you say lots of shit about your ex
to convince yourself
that it was the right decision.
But after a while,
you end up missing
even his flaws.
People are weird like that.
Unless it's an abusive relationship.
Maybe I had an abusive relationship
with swimming.
I doubt that.
I don't know many people your age
who have seen so much of the world.
I only saw the pools.
It's true that the pools in Moscow
and Budapest were really nice,
but they were just pools.
I'm not that sorry for you!
And think of this:
I've never booked a hotel room
or a flight myself.
Isn't that weird?
Okay sweetie,
I have to keep it short today.
I have to prioritize the swimmers
that have races tonight.
There you go, miss.
And you have to keep stretching
your lower back,
because you're going to be
sitting for longer periods.
-My fucking lower back, eh?
-Yeah, your fucking lower back...
Thank you.
I'M SLEEPING!
...BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE NOT A QUITTER!
-COACH
Nadia?
-Hey, Nadia!
-What?
Didn't you like my surprise?
You know I think you have more drive
than any swimmer I've ever met.
I don't want to see you go.
I had to try.
Try what?
Seriously, try what?
It's not up to you or anyone else
to try anything!
You don't seem to get
that this is my decision!
Can I maybe make a decision
by myself for once in my life?
Maybe have control over my life
for once?
Hold on.
Remember the first time
you ever swam 200 fly?
Do you remember?
I think you were 11.
Maybe 10. You were swimming
with Maryse, I think.
It was at...
our little Christmas meet,
just before the hot dog party.
I'd only been there around 3 months,
I coached the seniors.
I remember so well,
I saw you in the pool
and your stroke was a disaster.
You looked like you were drowning
but you went faster than anyone else.
But...
I remember I saw you and I said,
"That one will go far."
That's all I wanted to say.
I'm super fucking proud
to have come this far with you.
And I thank you.
At the same time! 
Can I have some lines too, please?
Sure, if you want.
ThatÕs it!
YouÕre not pouting anymore, eh?
The water's nice.
But really, you know,
you were right about one thing.
Athletes are selfish.
You know, you have your plans,
you're going to med school...
But me...
I'll be all alone.
You know...
Who will I race against
in practice?
Who will I room with
at meets?
Who will I bitch with?
Who will I goof off with?
Who will I cry with?
I'll still come cheer for you.
And you?
Will you still see me
if I don't swim anymore?
Well...
Unless you put on 40 pounds!
Say something.
Say something!
-What will you do with it?
-Just say something.
I saw Nadia fucking a Muslim
on MDMA in the Olympic Village!
YOLO bitches!
He wasn't Muslim, he was Christian.
Actually, an atheist.
Look.
