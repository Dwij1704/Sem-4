- Is it all right?
- No, it won't work.
It's broken down.
Come with us,
you can't stay there.
- Thanks, it's kind of you.
- You're welcome.
Shit, what shit!
Are we still far from Bujumbura?
We've just lost more than an hour!
Anyway, it's nice of you
to have picked us up.
Otherwise we would have had
to spend the night on the roadside.
I can say, here when it's dark...
It's really dark. Oh sorry...






Thank you.
Thank you very much.
What was I saying?
Yes, regarding the motor.
What can you do? Just open the hood,
that's all. The windows maybe?
Those garages, they do it
on purpose, don't they?
They put in small cross-topped screws.
There's nothing you can do.
Before, I could disassemble
a carburettor in 2 hours.
But they do it on purpose. Why?
So they access the motor themselves.
Not stupid!
Well, yes, they are!
What's going on?
Slow down!
Reverse! Go back!
Out!
Get out! Fast!
Out! Leave him alone!






Out!
Freddy, come back!
- Stay there!
- OK, OK!
Move on!
Hutus to the left
and the Tutsi snakes to the right.
Quick!
No.
The Hutus to the left
and the Tutsis to the right.
Hurry up!
Hey, show me your pass.
It's OK.
So you are trying to make us believe
that you are all Hutu brothers
and that there are no Tutsi lice
among you?
I doubt that.
Her, chief.
You, the big tall one, dare you tell me
that you are not a Tutsi bitch?
Well then, no. I am neither a Tutsi
nor a Hutu, still less a bitch.
I am Zairian, I am
and have nothing to do with all your stuff
about Tutsis and Hutus, left and right!
- I said: the big tall one to the right.
- I said I was Zairian.
Neither Tutsi, nor Hutu.
- I make it my business, Chief.
- I'm staying right here.
Shut up! Bastard!
You can stay there. Shut up!
- But I'm not...
- Shut your mug!
- And you?
- Me?
- Yes, you!
- Me, I have no idea.
What do you mean, you have no idea?
My mother was a Tutsi
and married a real Tutsi.
Wait, wait...
Even if she was a Tutsi, I was born
4 months after they married...
My mother was quite loose,
she was said to be together
with a Hutu businessman...
That is why he called me Sinsise,
the child you don't know where it's from...
Four months, it's impossible.
If it was at least 9 months.
- Mercy, Chief!
- OK, scram!
Thank you, Chief...
- Me too, Chief!
- What, are you called Sinsise too?
No, sir, but I too don't have a father...
I have never had a father.
But I have an uncle.
Besides, he is a bit like you.
In fact, he looks like you,
well-built, he is...
he's like me, he's like you, like all of us.
Physically, you all look alike.
Somehow... No?
Piss off! Enough!
- And me, where do I go?
- Do you want to get killed?
What's going on there?
He says he's from Musigati,
his father is a Pygmy.
- So what?
- He wants to join the others.
Get out of the way, Pygmy!
You... I know,
I can see you are a real Tutsi.
We shall bring you back
to your Somali ancestors.
No... Me, I'm Rwandan!
- Rwandan, so what?!
- His papers, Chief, if he's Rwandan.
Show me your papers.
We'll see which side your are on.
It's OK, he's a Hutu...
Yet you really look like a Tutsi,
don't you?!
- What about you?
- I'm his niece.
- Rwandan! Your papers.
- No, she's not from here, she's white.
- She's nothing, just a bitch.
- He's right, Chief.
- But...
- Yes, you're nothing.
She's nothing, no nationality,
no papers... Nothing.
What do you mean, she's nothing?
You must come from somewhere?
You know our language,
you make fun of me?! Your papers!
Leave her alone, we are going
to get our hands dirty.
- She's a foreigner!
- He's right.
- I said, your papers!
- I don't have any.
- Her father is a Greek mulatto.
- Yes, a white.
Yes, a white, he never recognized her.
Even her father doesn't want her!
She's a foreigner.
He said so: a foreigner.
- And he repeats it.
- What did I repeat?
- Thank you, Chief.
- What's that... 'Thank you'?!
Fool!
You too?
Speak up!
Have you lost your viper tongue?
Mister Chief, sorry to interrupt.
Just to tell you,
he doesn't speak your language.
He is Flemish.
We are in the van because
we had a small breakdown,
really nothing in fact,
a problem with the screwdriver...
We are working
for the Belgian government.
Freddy, give your passport.
He's Belgian.
- That doesn't mean anything, Chief.
- Stop! We said: to the right!
- He's Belgian, I said!
- But, Chief...
He's Belgian!
You, Sister,
we're in the same fight!
That's what you think!
I have six children,
the last two are twins.
That is what I'm fighting for.
If I don't feed them within 2 hours,
I'm going to be in for it.
So, if we're in the same fight, OK,
you go and offer them your breast
and you'll see what that means.
Take my breast!
Take it!
Come, Ernest.
The child!
- But it's my nephew!
- Shut up!
I'm going to blow your head off!
You, you were born
on the wrong side of the road.
What's your name?
What's your name, I said?
Clement Niyonkuru, sir.
Niyonkuru?
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Ngozi, borough of Mumba,
Karunga Hill, sir.
I'm a pupil of the Little Seminary.
I didn't do anything wrong, sir.
Athanase Niyonkuru, you know him?
He's my father.
He's been killed, sir.
Go and join the others...
Quick, on the double!
Stop, you were told: to the right!
- Leave him!
- What do you mean: leave him?
He's got to be stamped out
like the others of his race.
I won't soil my machete
for a less-than-nothing, a child.
Have you forgotten 72 and 88?
What they did to our families?
Didn't the Tutsis cut down our children
with their machetes?
You forget!
What's the matter with you?
I forget nothing.
I won't waste a bullet on a child.
- You must stamp him out!
- No... No!
He must be killed!
- Should be setting off, now!
- What?
I can't drive at night!
OK. Go back to your van!
Cockroach -
they multiply like rabbits.
Ever seen a child multiply?
A child indeed... But a Tutsi child.
So get on with it... We have to kill him.
Leave him, it's an order!
Hey, Chief?
Would you have a Tutsi cousin?
Do as you like!
- Give it.
- Go and fetch him.
Come, snake, step forward!
Hey you, the Tutsi, what's that?
A U2 song.
- What?
- A U2 song.
- Hutu song?
- No, from the U2.
Give it to me.
Give it.
Hey, guys, a Tutsi
that listens to Hutu songs!
Hutu music?
Here...
Madam.
- Excuse me, it's a bit dirty.
- You speak Kirundi?
But then, you are a Tu?
You too?
But Freddy?
You're a Burundian now?
No, I'm a Fleming. My adoptive father
comes from Lokeren.
He's a Fleming, at least sort of...
Because his mother was French
and his father was born in Berlin
but since he was a bit Jewish
on the side, he left Germany
to settle down in Antwerp in 1919...
It is complicated, isn't it?
