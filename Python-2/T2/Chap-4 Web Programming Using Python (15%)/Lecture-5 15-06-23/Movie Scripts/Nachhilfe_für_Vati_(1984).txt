Two cuts are enough for everyone?
Sure, don't forget the apples!
2nd
In that old rag
I'm not going with you.
3rd
Bettina wears the old sweater.
Mom, forbid that!
4th
Bettina, what's the point?
You have the new white man.
Come on!
But it scratches like this.
Nonsense! Put it on!
Put on! Come on, get dressed! Give it to me!
8th
Do you have to fight again?
Better look forward to the trip!
No, I prefer to stay at home.
Then you just stay at home.
10th
Be peaceful!
It is so nice weather.
Mom, leave me that!






I love him so
and he is more beautiful than the white one.
Please please!
Fine, but then at least make yourself
the hair together.
Uh!
And wash your hands
and clean your fingernails!
17th
They don't get any better.
Yes, yes, try it!
18th
Ouch, let it be!

Do not make a scene! Other girls
at your age are already vain.

Stop! Comb first.

Oh, you two! Here.
Always a couple.
* cheerful-romantic music *

People and their colors:
Rudolf, father

Lore, mother
Bettina, daughter






There, a rabbit! Yes.
27th
And there is another one! Yes.
And there a deer!

And an elephant there!
That's right, a green one!
30th
Hey
A heart and a soul,
your children.
Bettina is really nice.
Yes, but don't shout it out!
Sebastian played father again.
It was horrible.
A correct one would be better.
How so? We're fine.
(Travel guide) Please get dressed
at the entrance the felt slippers!
After the tour is lunch
planned in the "Wild Jäger".
May i ask?
Children, it starts.
Bettina, here!
I already have some.
Take mine!
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
Are you on shore leave?
No, I don't have a vacation on land.
You are welcome.
I don't go to sea anymore.
You don't go to sea anymore?
Not in 2 years.
May I? Clear.
An accident.
Yes, that's how it happens sometimes.
How are the children? Good.
I'll get it quickly.
No thanks! Greetings to you!
Why didn't you write us
that you no longer go to sea?
What for?
Lore, I have to.
What are you doing now?
I am under construction.
Oh?
Yes, I'm fine. And you?
Also. Are you married again
No.
And you? Neither.
Rudolf, everyone is already waiting.
All right.
This is my ex wife.
Day.
My colleague Udo.
We live together.
We are in a hurry.
Goodbye Goodbye
Yes, that was it.
Lore! Yes.
Not a bad surprise
to see you again.
This cabinet was ...
(quietly) Come along!
... from Matthias Wallbaum
Augsburg manufactured around 1600.
Go to the next room!
Here we show ...
Look,
who is going to the bus!
Man dad! Where?
Dad! Dad!
- Quiet!
This coin cabinet was made
by Gerard Daphnis in Berlin around 1695.
The closet is an example ...
A surprise! How is he?
Good. I'm even happy about it.
It is me
nothing at all.
It doesn't sound that way.
No, Erika. It's over.
At that time he could choose:
we or his ship.
He chose his ship
for his wanderlust.
I'm going crazy.
Bettina!
What are you doing there?
Can not you read?
Ladies and Gentlemen,
who does this child belong to?
Me, sorry.
You need more
take care of your children.
Where is sebastian
Dad! Dad!
Day, Sebastian! Day, dad!
Man, you grew up
You're still running around in things.
Where do you live now?
Pot guard.
Jägerallee 25. Write to me!
Clear.
I must. Take care!
* melancholic music *
Dear Dad!
* She listens to pop music. *
Is what?
No, I want to say good night.
You already have that.
Two is Better.
Sleep well!
Later, Bettina needs the dress.
Good night.
Good night.
And finally sleep now!
Mom.
Are you happy
Do you mean now or at all?
Both.
Yes, you can say that.
You're happy too.
Or do you have any grief?
No no.
Everything is already going its way.
My father.
Mine.
My dear dad!
I need you.
Sonja fails and you go with us!
Everyone immediately agreed.
I'm really looking forward. Wonderful!
What? Hungary? I?
We have to work, but exchange!
Finally something else, different company.
What do i do with the kids
Place somewhere on vacation.
You just say that.
Do you want to or not?
Of course I want to
but it doesn't work.
You old mother!
Then you just stay at home.
You just pretend
as if they were still in diapers.
Think of yourself!
You are right.
Maybe there is a way.
Leave me time to think!
We don't have time!
"Leapt light courage
with sing and sang.
Then she suddenly saw
a lighter stands in front of them. "
I have one pig too many.
What am I going to do with that?
Butcher!
Nonsense, better help me!
Where, then?
There.
* The record is still running. *
There are 21 pigs in a barn.
It's so simple.
Name 3 options! N / A!
Bettina!
Either 4 bays with 4 pigs
and a bay with 5 pigs.
Or?
10 bays or ...
20 bays?
Exactly.
Thank you! Get it, get it!
Stupid math! Away with it!
You, Bettina! Yes.
What if you were out for days
don't have to wash and move?
That would be great.
I know where you can do that.
Where, then?
With dad and his friend Udo.
We could go there
when mom goes to Hungary.
No, to daddy without me.
Bettina, why not?
Dad has a big house
with a huge garden.
Imagine it!
Early in the morning
barefoot on the meadow.
Yes? No.
Or bathe in a swimming pool
he certainly has.
Does he also have animals?
Sure, dogs and cats ...
Ponies maybe?
Yes, quite possible.
And a car?
Of course.
And bicycles?
Clear.
Bicycles, television, hammock,
Swing, cats, dogs, ponies.
I've already written to him
that we are coming.
Is that true?
Good day.
- Day.
Good day.
Here for your colleagues in Hungary.
Hungary?
I wanted to do it first
but I don't do it.
I can not just you
send to your father.
But it is the only way.
Good day.
Thank you very much.
I know one more.
I cancel in the company.
Cancel? You do not do this.
Dad is really happy about us.
Dad is the solution.
Sebastian ...
Just let me do it!
You always rely on me.
Right.
But this time it's all of us.
But Bettina also wants to go to dad.
Absolutely even.
You helped out there. Or?
No, should I help you?
Are you sure
that your father wants you?
Yes, otherwise he would have telegraphed.
So it was agreed.
It's about time anyway
that he takes care of his children.
And now he has time on land.
But I still have a lot to do.
The laundry and the bank, the bank.
I need a rope.
We have to tie up the prisoners.
Please help me!
They have to go to the neighbor now.
I had one here.
Do you mean a bird
There He is.
Take the flower pot, Bettina!
Stop! Otherwise there will be a bang!
I only say "Hungary".
That'll do you good.
Here, drink!
* Cackling chickens,
someone is playing the harmonica. *
* He plays the song
"My Bonnie is over the ocean".
Rudolf, come on! We miss the train.
What's happening?
- I have to pee.
I want to be alone.
- Hoppala.
Boys, wait!
Take some cake with you!
Grandma, our train is about to go.
You're always in a hurry.
Would you have gotten up earlier?
Got up?
We didn't even lie down.
Oh, you guys.
Hey, who's going to take the cake?
I'll do it. Thank you very much!
Good.
Take care, my boy.
Take care, my boy.
Bye, grandma.
Bye, you two.
Greetings Anke and Detlef!
- Yes.
And Christa and Kurt
and Günter and Ilse.
I do.
Barbara, Carola, Heike.
Yes, bye. Bye
The train is already there.
Find a phone right away
when you have arrived!
You know the number.
When I'm not at work ...
Then with Aunt Erika.
Get in!
So!
Do you have your money
Put it in! Ticket?
Yes.
Not while driving
go to the doors!
Bettina if you have to
take Sebastian with you!
So mom!
Please go back!
Where's your chocolate
Wait! Go in there!
Here!
Have a good trip and be nice
and don't disgrace me
No, mom! Have fun in Hungary.
Thank you and greet your father!
Dad is getting powerful
waiting for us.
Man, i am tired.
A letter for you.
From whom?
By Sebastian.
Later!
Express Mail. Yes / Yes.
Sebastian is always in a hurry.
That's nice!
This heavenly calm!
Nothing beats having your own bed.
And an undisturbed sleep.
Day, dad! Here we are.
No! Bettina!
Udo! Please tell me I'm dreaming!
Bettina, come here!
Bettina, come now!
I go on the phone.
I want to tell mom myself
that with dad everything is crap.
You can't do that with ice cream in the store.
Be nice! Do not make a scene!
Bettina.
Fine, but at least tell her
that we will come back today.
I don't like it at all.
Then she just drives
not to Hungary.
Hi Mom.
Do you hear me?
Here is Basti.
Everything is great with Daddy, wonderful.
Yes, garden nice.
House beautiful.
Yes, he also has a car.
Was Dad waiting for you?
He was happy.
He's doing what? Is he on vacation now?
That fits great, I'm glad.
Get me Bettina!
How so? Where is she?
Oh dad. Clear.
And how do you like it? Fine.
Well, then I can drive in peace.
Basti, you are very, very great.
What is?
Why break up?
Right, you have to pay.
I'll write right away and you too!
Stay healthy, you two!
And greet your father and Udo nicely!
Bye
About the boy
his father can be happy.
My son!
N / A?
Off to Hungary.
50 pfennigs.
- And a family pack of ice cream.
And 2.85 marks makes 3.35 marks. You're welcome.
Here.
I still have ice cream.
When do we go home?
Not at all.
Mom was no longer there.
She already had to go to Hungary today.
Mummy is already flying.
With whom did you speak?
With the shift supervisor, as I said.
This is unbelievable.
It is already in Hungary.
This is unbelievable.
What shall we do now?
Rudolf, resign yourself to it!
Where should they sleep?
There is an air mattress in the shed.
I do not want to sleep,
I want to eat something.
Wedding cake!
- Bettina, that's great.
No, after so much ice
I want something else.
There is nothing else.
Either cake or nothing.
Accept it!
I have to.
And now you sleep.
Don't you have a nightie with you?
No, what for?
I always sleep in underwear.
What?
But not with me. Put this on!
No, this is my favorite sweater.
I sleep like this.
It's out of the question.
I have order.
I mean in stuff like that.
Without nightgown.
Rudolf, don't be silly!
Let her sleep the way she wants!
Little cucumber!
Don't interfere, Udo!
I am the father.
Come on Sebastian!
And now you put that on!
I want to go home.
I want to see my mom.
It sucks here.
But who will be sad?
because of such cinnamon?
It's not worth it, little cucumber.
OK?
You know what?
I'm going to buy you a sausage now.
Where, then?
In the pub. OK?
Good.
Now you're shining again
like an asterisk.
I fly, I hurry.
See you,
and no longer be sad!
* Rudolf is playing to himself. *
You know how i me
looking forward to my bed?
Who do you say that to?
Come on!
Such a little bitch.
Just grab your bed.
And then there is
in your good wash.
Let them!
She's funny, your daughter.
You call that funny?
She sleeps in underwear.
It creates me, Udo.
I can't deal with that anymore.
It's not a condition here either.
In addition on our vacation.
They have to go again.
But where?
Let's do it
sleep in first!
If necessary, we bring them
to my sister Anke.
Sure, leave the kids there. Bottom up!
There is enough food here
and beds too.
And I'm on vacation.
Send things to me soon!
I'll do that, Anke.
Thank you very much.
Leave it there!
You see, everything scratched.
I'm talking to Grandma tonight.
- I'd rather negotiate that alone.
I do it more diplomatically.
Thank you very much.
Then we talk to the children.
Bettina feels very comfortable here.
And Sebastian too.
Say, we have to
explain to the children at all?
(from below) Hard or soft eggs?
- Turnout.
You can't just be your kids
push off and drive away.
Grandma, he just can't do anything
start with them.
I do not know ...
At first he was always at sea and after
after the divorce he no longer saw her.
Back then he was just thinking about himself
and his freedom.
Then he was young and inexperienced.
But a father has to
take care of his children.
He would have the opportunity to do that now.
Aren't you a little strict, Grandma?
That can all still be.
Then when?
These are all things.
This male economy in Udo's arbor!
It is an absurdity.
And then the thing
with his exam.
He failed
and don't want to do it again.
A smart head and satisfied with it
as a henchman on the building.
I do not understand that.
Come on, get dressed! Get dressed!
We have to leave quickly.
Why then?
I'll tell you afterwards.
And dad and udo?
They are already gone.
Path? Without us?
Unfortunately, we have to go afterwards.
It looks like the father again.
Get out and let us down.
Like back then with the ship.
Stop talking,
which you don't understand
Now come!
Hm ...
The boat is good. Yes.
But you have to put a lot of money into it.
Just like in your car and the arbor.
That is clear.
* cheerful-romantic music *
You and your occasional purchases!
It's almost a tick.
It makes a lot of fun,
what old to rebuild.
I can do it again.
Arbor, car and boat.
But that also takes a lot of time.
That is.
And when do you take your exam?
Never again.
I also make my money like that.
Without a degree?
Do you want the eternal Max
make on site?
I can not.
I just can not.
I'm not just too lazy.
A lot of learning
is no longer possible at my age.
Practically yes, but theoretically ...
It is all a matter of will. Come over!
You also catch
from the boat more than from the shore.
A lot more is good.
But it is enough for the two of us.
But not for four.
Is what?
The air is out.
We have to buy patchwork tomorrow.
That you can't cycle
but that amazes me.
I once had years ago
an accident with the scooter.
I've been scared ever since.
I understand that.
Stop again!
Well, one more time, but quickly.
They're waiting for the rolls.
Kick, Bettina! To step!
Watch out! Hold on! Hold on!
Bettina! Did you hurt yourself?
No.
Come over!
Come on! Get on!
Tomorrow I'll lower the saddle
and then you learn to ride a bike.
That would be great.
Mum would be very happy about that.
* Udo whistles happily to himself. *
Hi!
Does Sebastian Herbst live with you?
Yes I am.
You?
Yes.
A telegram. You're welcome.
Thank you very much.
Come on!
Over there by the crane
your father and I work.
Yes? Come over!
My God! How long does it take?
They probably buy the consumption empty.
That would be great.
My hunger is huge.
I wanted you all
Time say: I have money with me.
Wait! You can have everything.
Do you want to insult me?
No, but you take care of us.
So what?
You still have to
pay off the arbor.
Mind your own business?
I have enough money.
I could buy a boat.
The arbor is already paid.
Almost anyway.
Listen!
Don't mix
in my affairs!
I can not stand that.
But you're my father.
Fresh rolls, fresh rolls
and a telegram from mom!
Show me!
There's something on it for you too, dad.
"Budapest is great.
Thank you very much, Rudolf. Greeting. Mommy. "
Stay an hour away!
Are you crazy?
Indeed.
We were at your construction site.
That's why it took so long.
And we met your brigadier.
So? And what did he say?
Think of the special shift on Friday!
That’s clear.
And that you can be proud of
Bettina. She looks very much like you.
"And greet the old bottle!"
Man, stop it!
Shit if you're forgetful.
Crap!
Udo! Is it better now?
No!
Make the box out!
The trickle is enough.
Broken roof, broken swing,
Broken car, broken TV.
And he's dirty too.
Clean up, princess!
Do something whole,
King broken!
Be careful, you little bitch!
Woe, you do me something!
I have a toothache.
Don't believe it! She wants to
just make it interesting.
What is there?
Silent film.
It will be an entertaining evening.
What else did you do
In the evening, I mean.
What else have we done?
Drinked beer, talk to us.
Played cards.
Had a visit, visits to bars.
Nightly?
It was very entertaining.
I also like to go to pubs.
I just missed that.
You in a pub.
Guys, I have it.
We play double-headed.
Great, I can do that.
Who taught you that?
My friends.
But I can't.
I'll teach it to you.
Then let's see.
Now I'm excited.
There is no point in starting.
I win anyway.
Not so cheeky.
- You cucumber.
So I'm going to announce a wedding.
Watch out! You are ahead
and now play the ace.
Then it will be our sting.
OK then. We belong Together.
And now right after that.
Are they still going?
Not here, in the wild.
It was a bargain.
Very cheap.
I would have done that too.
The crankshaft is broken
and a few little things.
But I can do it again.
Clear.
You only need spare parts.
And money.
Leave it!
Don't mix
in my money matters!
I can not stand it.
Excuse me.
Are you making me the meadow now?
That doesn't work with the old thing.
You're welcome.
What are you doing?
We try it
with work today.
We can also do something?
What?
Cover roof. Material is there.
Cover roof?
It's a drag
to cover the roof.
So what? It's nice weather.
Come on, let's get started!
If I start something
I have to finish it too.
How so? I will help you.
You always with your jostling.
* swinging Hungarian music *
* swinging violin music *
*Music*
Nice greetings from me. Clear!
Write to him that you are fine.
And that you will come back soon.
And that the ice cream tastes good.
Yes.
Aster.
That was a nice day today.
Do you think Yes.
Does it still hurt?
What.
How did that happen?
I had forgotten the wedges
to pull out of the loading hatches.
Then the cover plate started to slide,
and in my cross.
I lay there and the others thought
i would be dead.
That would be horrible.
It's pretty lame
if it's your own fault
You know,
how much I liked being on my ship.
And then I should
work in the port.
But I was able to expire
Don't watch ships.
Swam over it!
I have already overcome it.
Nearly.
And firm ground underfoot
is not bad either.
Even the beautiful view here.
And now we have each other
deserves a shower.
Well.
You are great, dad.
You would have
can spin about your accident.
Attention,
there are a few rungs missing.
Cook something to eat!
The pub is closed today.
Cook? What?
Spaghetti, what else.
That is the only thing you can do.
Great! Come on, Bettina.
Delicious!
Udo!
Spaghetti! Such a beautiful day.
Do you find?
No, I can no longer.
Just a little more sauce.
What shoud that?
You still fall off the chair?
I want to know what I look like.
I can tell you
the way you look.
Like an old strubbeliese.
Then you have to me
wash my hair?
Are you serious!
Yes, I want to look pretty
and clean.
We like you too.
Yes, but Udo may not.
It's sausage.
No.
Good Morning. Now I'm tired.
Always tomorrow! Mom never says that.
Wash her turnip!
Then the Quengelliese gives peace.
I don't have a shampoo either.
It doesn't matter. Then ...
Then you take this here.
Soap is soap, dad.
Then let's go, but head over here.
Oh, cold.
Dad, write some greetings too!
Then mom is happy.
Very briefly!
"Many kisses, your Rudolf."
Watch out!
Finally you're there!
Then we can play cards.
I'm starting to stink here.
Dig up beds during the day,
this holiday pleasure in the evening.
What are you doing with the vinegar?
My hair should shine.
Ugh devil.
She wants to look pretty.
Put something on your head!
No pig can stand that.
Man, Udo! Don't you like that!
It gets worse with time.
A hat or I evaporate.
I have to sleep in the hut.
You look sharp, sister.
Let's play Mau-Mau!
I'm pissed off. I have vacations.
Yeah. Here!
Precious vacation.
Do you understand that?
Heart is asked.
Here you waste your time.
I wish Piek.
And now pee.
Suck this arbor life.
The same thing every night.
And he's still playing badly.
Leave Sebastian alone! It is still
no master fell from heaven.
No, and not a skilled worker either.
Please leave that!
For an argument
the arbor is too small.
Udo, who did you get the arbor from?
From my aunt.
Is she dead
Yes.
Were you happy
No.
But you could be happy.
I liked the aunt.
Does the arbor now belong to dad?
Either play cards
or ask questions.
Exactly, now I have
lost track of things.
You and overview!
- Now I don't feel like it anymore.
But I. Come on, keep playing!
Right, cucumber!
You forgave my daughter.
Dear God, a deeply concerned
Father speaks up.
But as you say.
I leave the field to you.
Have fun with your children.
Udo, wait! Stay here!
I come with!
You're mean to get Udo out of here.
And what are we going to do now?
We play
Don't annoy you.
No, I'm already annoyed enough.
Do we want to practice math?
Maths? Otherwise you can't think of anything.
Mom always knows something.
Mom! Mom!
Would you have stayed with her!
I asked you not to come here.
Or do you think it's fun
to play the filler?
No, I make 3 crosses
when you're gone
This is what it looks like.
You wanna go too, dad?
You must not.
I have a toothache.
You are my father
All of a sudden?
Daddy, please stay!
This is your fault, you stupid cow.
I can not stand this anymore.
I can not stand this anymore.
Have you already found something?
No not yet.
* Bettina is crying. *
Do it, Bastian!
No tablets anywhere.
Not even with Udo.
Meanness.
They're sitting in somewhere now
the pub while I'm dying here.
Where are they
Help me, Bastian!
How come? How then?
Ouch! Man, that hurts.
You're just making things worse.
I want to see my mom.
I want to see my mom.
I believe you about that.
Wait, I'm going to search again.
You can't even get here
to be at peace. Oh!
This constant paternalism.
Building the brigade
and at home you.
You know how that pisses me off
how you play up
I do not need any help,
not even with my children.
I am the father.
I manage very well on my own.
I also know best
what my kids lack.
What's broken here?
She needs pills, dad.
Do you have any?
I have such a toothache.
Please help me!
It is all red and hot.
I'm sure she has a fever.
I think we have to go to the doctor.
It's a thing.
Pack the things together!
Bettina, we have to go to town.
To the doctor.
Middle of the night?
But how then, dad?
By bike. How else?
Put a pillow on the back
so that she can sit better.
Go on! We have to go.
No. Only if Udo comes along.
Be reasonable!
I am your father and help you.
What do you need the Udo for?
I will take you there. No!
You get too
5 marks compensation for pain and suffering.
No I do not want to,
and when I die.
Udo has to go. Ouch!
Udo, are you sleeping already?
Yeah, damn it.
Get well soon, cucumber!
Ready to go?
I just want to know what she has.
Udo then stays with her.
Can you stand it alone for so long?
Sure, I'm going to bed.
* Wind howls. *
That was just missing.
Crap!
* Rumbling *
Here, rescue center.
But here is the registration.
Registration! Isn't there anyone here?
A severe case of thunderstorm!
The lightning struck.
Here too! Registration!
Young man, what are we missing?
A dentist.
Watch yourself
the pile of misery!
Oh my gosh!
Wait, I come across.
* Rumbling *
Udo!
And the boy at home alone!
Come! I think it is urgent.
Get going! Here!
Thank you.

(Radio) The meteorological service
issues a severe weather warning.
In the evenings and at night in the districts
Rostock, Schwerin and Neubrandenburg

Partly about it.
Motorists and pedestrians are supposed to
watch out for falling branches and roof tiles
and exercise caution. "
Something must have happened there.
I'm coming.
I search for you.
* Rumbling *
Well finally!
I thought,
you won't come back
How was it?
What did they do to you
Poor little pickle.
Come on, I can take it.
Didn't the dentist smell anything?
No.
Dad! Dad!
Why are you running out here?
What did you promise me
I wish I could
you a few long ones.
Get away from the big trees here! Come on!
Rub your hair dry!
Shit weather!
Now I must
but again on the roof.
Bloody mess that me
always have to do everything twice!
That doesn't harm you at all.
How do you mean?
Only like that.
Your mother wrote.
She will pick you up on the 8th.
So you can be happy.
You will be rid of me soon.
So now you don't stink anymore.
Come over!
Udo.
You can marry me in 7 years.
I'm 16
Listen!
I am twice as old.
It doesn't matter.
Are you waiting for me?
Waiting?
Maybe you'll become one
Super thick or a super thin.
Or a super pretty one
that all run after.
I would have to make an effort
as an old 30 year old man.
How do you smell - Oops!
Such an expensive shampoo.
- What must be must be.
You are very rude to your sister.
No feeling for women.
Udo!
Finally go shopping!
I'm hungry.
Here are 10 marks.
Yes, soon.
I am still completely wet.
Stay here, then it will be faster.
No, I want mine for mine
Pain compensation buy something sweet.
Lose another tooth.
Oh, this one has grown back.
5, you said 5.
Quite forgetful.
Little bitch, your sister.
How does your mom cope?
Nothing special.
Except for Udo, nobody makes it.
Look here.
That is a beautiful dress.
Oh, there are sweaters here.
I would like this.
* The man translates. *
It costs 850 forints.
- Yes, 850.
Erika!
That suits you perfectly.
And it suits me.
And you have to leave briefly? Ciao!
Goodbye!
Rudolf certainly likes it too.
Perhaps.
And the shirt is for you too?
Stop, I won't say anything else.
I am very happy that everything
works so well with the children.
Naturally.
I take that. The kids are now
definitely in Rudolf's swimming pool.
Oh, it's cold.
Xaver, what do we do
only today without udo?
I'll think of something.
So, what do you look like?
I think we go swimming.
I was dirty.
Then pack your bathing suit!
We don't have any.
We have forgotten them.
You do not have bathing suits with you?
No.
Then I have to buy you some.
Very powerful.
Mine was too small for me anyway
and no longer chic.
(quietly) shut up!
How so? It is really too small.
Yes / Yes.
Well, that was the boat.
It looks really nice.
And this is inexpensive.
- Yes.
Significantly cheaper.
Take this one!
It is much nicer and cheaper.
Udo loves colorful
and I want it for the garden.
This one here.
Then I'll take this one.
25 marks 59.
Bastian, look, rubber boots.
The sand rubs in my sandals.
Then go barefoot!
Barefoot?
Dad, look!
Aren't they beautiful?
Yes wonderful.
And you? Do you still need something?
No, but you.
A shirt, you always wear the same thing.
Nonsense, a shirt.
How about an ice cream?
Yes.
Thank you. Your ice cream.
No, I have no appetite.
We don't want to
to the beach chairs?
Oh, here it is
but also quite nice.
Put on your swimsuit!
What else did you buy it for?
Touch it!
Come here!
You also! Clothes down!
Wait a minute!
What is the nonsense?
Pretty, your new suit.
Yes.
Bastian, look!
Sebastian in panties!
Is it for me?
Yes.
What's that about?
Why don't you have anything in the store
said you stupid sheep?
Takes care of my shirt
and forgets his pants.
Unbelievable,
walking around in my underpants.
You have to be there
as a father ashamed of you
*sad music*
Throw to me!
Not in the water!
Be careful!
* The kids scream in confusion. *
Human!
* Air escapes from the ball. *
The beautiful ball!
Wouldn't we prefer to run away?
Daddy, my ball! My ball!
Where's Daddy?
He swam out.
There he sits.
It is typical of you.
What are you looking for?
What to eat.
Dad didn't take anything.
What? Didn't take anything with you?
I want to get out of here.
It sucks here.
I know.
Come up with something new!
I want to go home.
You, dad!
Bettina wants to go home.
He doesn't like it anymore.
Rest first!
Are you stretching now?
at least the legs?
Sure, I have the 2nd swim level.
Aha.
You always scolded
when I learned to swim.
Yes.
"Stretch your legs!
It won't be anything else! "
The swimming master was very angry
because you always got involved
Yes I remember.
It was a bad summer.
Totally raining.
The lido was completely empty.
Only you poor had to go into the water.
And you were freezing.
When the water gets more
sloshed up on the belly ...
I was careful on the edge
that you don't come out
But I felt sorry for you.
Do you believe me
Now yes.
It's okay if you
sometimes what is forced.
* Ship's horn from a distance *
How far is that outside?
2 nautical miles.
A bit further.
A Kümo, exactly.
I still have all your ships
that you made me back then.
The trawler, the brig,
the tanker, the Kümo.
Everyone is on my shelf.
Mom moans because of
of dusting.
But I do
now mostly myself.
Come on! The little cucumber
is already crying.
* They laugh happily to themselves. *
Now watch what Rudolf does!
Bravo.
Great dad. Nice!
N / A? Now off! Come on, you two!
Do you really believe,
that Udo will marry me?
Sure, why not?
You're right.
Wait the few years
what's that?
Geez!
Dad?
Where do you want to go?
We have to go home immediately.
I didn't feed Udo's bird.
Come on!
Should my bird die?
The bowl was completely empty.
Away with the bag!
I have fed him long ago.
Don't you like that!
Your Xaver is still alive.
A little weight loss
is good for him.
Don't be angry with me anymore, Udo!
Leave him, Bettina!
He is in a bad mood.
Why actually?
Because Suzy didn't want to stay here
in this mess.
There is no corner here
for yourself.
I am now moving to the hotel with Susi.
Susi? Who is susi
I.
My bride
Aren't you done yet?
- Come over! Bye
Bye
Bettina!
Bettina!
Bettina!
Where is it
* soft sobs *
Quiet!
I now know where it is.
Go in there!
Come on, go inside!
Bettina.
Bettina, come on out!
It's uncomfortable in here.
No.
I stay all night.
Until mom comes.
And I want the Udo
never see again.
Sebastian said
Udo marries me.
And now ...
Now he has a bride.
This is a bad pain.
But this is
like a tooth gap.
It grows over time.
Now stop howling!
Otherwise I'll start right away.
Oh you! And who is practicing now
cycling with me?
I still can't get down
and mom is coming soon.
I and if you want, the same.
Really, dad?
Clear.
I'll show you how to descend.
Come on, quickly!
Watch out now!
Do you get it now? Yes.
I can dismount, dad. Thank you.
Here for you.
Do you know what you did?
Talking to the little one
Udo marries her.
How do you deal with feelings?
And how do you deal with it?
You are in need of it.
You don't get
why I bathe in underpants.
You don't get
why I'm looking for you in the storm
And now why me
Rushing Bettina for Udo.
Guess why me
came here at all!
For the sake of your mother. Why else?
You believe that? You believe that?
Do not act like that,
as if you need a father!
That would make you laugh.
Then laugh, you stupid guy!
It's okay, boy.
It's okay.
* The church clock strikes 3 times. *
Poor Xaver! Are you hungry?
Udo would be right
if you were dead
Poor bird.
* loud crowing *
Thank you, little cucumber.
Red like your favorite sweater.
Bye
What does the food do?
The bean soup is ready.
That will taste mummy.
Yes I believe that too.
If only she was already here.
We can
pass the time a bit.
How about math?
How are you at school
Medium or average?
What do you want to be?
I do not know.
At nine you have to know
what you want to be.
You are a little idiot. No.
But want to marry Udo.
First learn something right!
No, I'm not studying. You're also
too lazy to do your exam.
Day, children! Day, Rudolf!
So there I am.
Good day.
Am i early
Do you have my letter
not got?
But! Nice that you're back.
Day, mom.
You can eat with us.
It's done: bean soup.
Come on, mom!
It looks great, pretty.
It is really pretty.
Dad already started.
It's really cozy here.
That is why the children
comfortable here.
Dad took good care of us.
Right, Bettina?
Yes, he always practiced math with me.
And our suitcase
is already packed.
Dad has everything
washed and ironed.
That was not necessary.
It wasn't that bad.
Thanks for the nice days
in Budapest!
And that I could drive with peace of mind.
Well ...
Have you been to Lake Balaton? No.
How did you get on in the company?
Good after initial difficulties.
And how was it in Budapest?
Wonderful! Wait a moment!
Can I give you that?
You love it checkered.
A shirt? Yes.
Thank you very much.
I can make good use of this.
I am glad.
And where is mine
At home, of course.
That's obvious.
Tell about Budapest
and operating there?
Did you meet someone
Yes.
We have no more time
to tell.
Your train is leaving soon.
Otherwise you have to drive in the evening.
But I bring you
to the train station, of course.
You can still eat in peace.
When does the train leave?
I also write sometimes. Bye
If you had said
that you still like him, mom.
What makes you think that?
It was a little strange.
Almost sad.
This is what you say goodbye to.
Have a look!
Grandmother lost a tooth.
Not lost, drawn.
Drawn?
Was it bad?
Dreadful.
And where's the tooth now?
I gave it to Udo.
Who is udo
My friend.
Your friend.
My hair clips!
Bettina! Bettina, come here!
Day.
Huhu, Bastian!
Is there mail? No.
All right.
Again no dad's mail.
I am so ...
Why doesn't he write to me?
I am worried about him?
Here, come!
I do not want,
that he is rotten.
I love him as much as you do.
If not better.
Are you mad at me now?
No.
I can't be mad at you
if you love your father
Basti, leave him alone now.
If he needs you
he answers.
Not at all.
Dad is too proud.
He never admits anything.
Can I invite you for coffee?
- With you always.
Let me out.
Sebastian needs me at home.
Visiting his father
has troubled him.
I think he misses him a lot.
And you?
The Maxi or the Resi?
- Resi.
It's already twelve.
Don't you get mail today?
No, never again.
Here!
Then I do it.
There's nothing in there anyway.
Let it be!
Let it be.
Can I help you?
No.
It just happens
not all wishes in life.
It is difficult to understand.
Come on, Basti!
Again no dad's mail.
Only himself.
Man dad!
Human!
Day. Day.
Bettina sown them.
Do you want ...
Well, the car.
I came,
to celebrate with you.
Celebrate what, dad?
What?
About your skilled worker?
What else? It was about time.
I am happy about that.
I congratulate. Thank you.
Do you want to eat Gladly.
Great, come on!
Bean soup always, right?
Clear.
I missed you a lot.
Here.
Come here!
Thank you.
And they are mine.
Nice.
What does your gap do anyway?
Almost too.
Wonderful.
We are
invited to Udo’s wedding.
And mom too?
If she wants.
But actually I want to
don't see the Udo again.
I think the gap is closed.
No, almost only.
I sew a great dress for you.
Then you are the most beautiful.
Great, then sew up
dear one!
So that dad gets back into you
in love and marry you again.
Dad, that's the idea.
Where you like so much
do everything twice.
