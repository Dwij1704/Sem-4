Hello aunt Nabat.
Hello Jabir.
You haven't run out of firewood? - No.
Let me know when it's finished.
Thank you.
Hello aunt Nabat.
Hello my girl.
Hello.
Ay girl, where are you?
We're going.
Hello Giyas.






Hello aunt Nabat.
Let me help you.
I hope it sells.
Thank you.
Are you coming, mum?
I'm coming.
Hello Telli.
Hello, dear.
How are you? - OK.
How is your husband?
So-so...
Sometimes OK...
sometimes...
He's not eating well.






Oh, I don't know.
Come and sit down.
They were shooting again yesterday.
Yes, I heard it.
What do you think?
I don't know.
God knows.
Yesterday my daughter Irada left as well.
After the missile fell by the school
her youngest couldn't sleep.
She sits up every night crying
that a bomb might fall.
I told Irada, the girl will go mad;
they should get out.
They've gone to the town.
That's a good job; I can relax a bit.
Davud came yesterday.
He said it's worse.
My bones say it will be bad.
Ah, Davud!
Take this, Aunt Nabat.
Thank you. - Thank you.
I'd better get back,
my husband is alone. Bye!
Take care, Nabat. Say hello to him.
Alright. See you soon. Bye.
Take care.
I can't tell her there
are fewer buying milk.
Try to take it from her, at least.
She has no one.
Yes, I know.
Heard anything about Oruj's son?
Not since he left.
And nothing from my nephew
three kids left!
There's no end to this war.
God help us.
Amen.
Brought any wood?
A few bundles.
God bless you,
and let us fetch it one day.
Hello. - We'll go together.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, my son.
Hello aunt.
What about our son's photo?
There's only one of him
and you've lost it!
I swear you never gave me one of him.
I've told you to ask
the village chairman, Davud.
He was collecting photos of the fallen.
Aren't you the only photographer here?
Every photo goes through you.
My God! Isn't there another one?
Bring it and I'll enlarge it.
No, only one.
I wish I hadn't brought it.
Why did I take it off the wall?
You haven't looked very hard!
What was in it? What was he wearing?
Look, like him!
With a star on his beret.
I swear I don't have
any pictures of fallen soldiers.
You've lost it...
my child's photo...
and you don't care.
Hello aunt Nabat.
I want to see Davud.
I'll tell him.
Thank you.
Davud, the Soviet Union is no more!
Now we all obey
the Azerbaijan Republic's law.
What do you mean, you can't?
I give you two days!
Hello my girl.
Nabat, what's the matter?
Hello. - Hello.
I came for the photo.
What photo?
Our boy's photo.
What photo, woman?
Can't you see all these people?
Another time?
Nabat!
Nabat!
Wait a minute!
Nabat!
Hello aunt Nabat.
Hello Nariman.
Hello.
Hello, aunt Nabat.
How are you?
How is your husband?
Thank you for asking.
I respect him so much.
I tell myself to visit him,
but I never manage it.
Here's your flour. Anything else?
A pack of Tea.
And a kilo of sugar.
Here's the tea.
There was never a gamekeeper like him.
He scared us away from hunting!
He always said,
"Don't shoot the animals, lads".
We'd ask, "So where should we shoot?"
He was one of a kind.
There's hardly an animal left
with all this shooting.
Here you are.
Thank you.
How much will that be?
4 manats, 20 qapiks.
Your prices go up every week, son.
It's not me, it's them.
It isn't worth working these days.
You see how it is?
My old parents keep me here.
I have a nice house
and everything in the town.
They don't want to leave.
You wouldn't understand.
Say hello to your mother.
And say hello to your husband.
Thank you.
Nabat.
Yes dear.
You're back?
Yes.
How are you?
So-so. What's the news?
Everything is OK.
Beshir has a grandchild now.
It's a boy.
The weather is too warm.
It's like summer outside.
Ah, it was Shama's daughter's engagement.
I went... and drank sherbet.
I congratulated them for you too.
The boy is from the next village.
He is blacksmith Pasha's son.
He's studying in Baku.
Everything is fine.
Aren't you hungry, my dear?
No.
Eat a little
you have to take your medicine.
No.
Isgender, I'm hungry too.
No. You said only a little...
Alright.
Isgender.
Yes.
Your pill.
Throw them away. They're no use now.
Starting again? Open your mouth!
What's going on?
I saw the photographer.
He was very busy.
I'll pick it up in a day or two.
Get up, we're leaving.
Start the car, sergeant.
Jabiyev, listen to me.
You exhaust me Davud.
What could I do?
The old men don't want to go.
The young can't leave them here.
Jabiyev listen to what I'm saying.
Give me a chance to speak.
Davud, I don't think you understand.
It's easy for you to talk.
One says this, another says that.
I've lost my head.
Damn this!
Drive on.
Animals shouldn't be in a war zone.
Why hasn't that one left?
My beautiful Aghja.
Are you alright?
Nabat.
Yes, my dear.
Are you awake?
Yes.
They're shooting again.
When you go out tomorrow
ask Mullah Khalil to come.
Why do you need him?
I just want to talk to him.
I didn't listen to you before.
We should have retired to the village.
What...
What will you do...
when I'm gone?
It's gone on longer this time.
Giyas.
Hey Telli
daughter-in-law.
Telli.
Hey Telli
daughter-in-law.
Ruhi.
Shamama.
Nabat.
You're burning me.
Add cold water.
Alright?
Yes, OK.
Are you kidding?
You remember Murad?
He always cried when I bathed him
and I sang to him.
Oh God, give me five like him
and the birds in the sky five like him.
Alright?
OK
Where is that thick hair, hey Nabat?
You bewitched me with your hair then.
But I kidnapped you very well.
There was the farm chief's son,
what was his name?...
You don't know who kidnapped who.
Ah, now you say it.
May your parents rest in peace.
I feel better now.
I'll give you some nice fresh tea.
No.
Give me some cool water.
Alright.
Did you see the mullah?
It's back again, damned animal.
This looks serious.
Hang a lantern on the stable door.
And open the cover
over the hole in the path.
Cover it with straw.
Leave the lights on.
Animals usually gather in dark places.
My beautiful Aghja.
Aghja, what's up?
No milk?
Damned cow.
Come... Come...
Come... Come...
Come... Come...
How beautiful you are, how good you are.
I'm listening, Major Jabiyev.
Yes colonel.
Chinarli village.
Of course, we've evacuated everyone.
No one left.
I'm also interested in
why they haven't taken the village.
You know, perhaps Colonel...
Hello, hello...
Aghja!
Aghja!
Aghja!
Why don't you leave?
Get them tight.
