Regression:-
> Good Corellation means the original value is close to Prediction value
> Single -> y=mx+c
> Multiple -> y=m1x1+m2x2+m3x3+c
> Example for multiple: Predictiono  of price of a car, the parameters that affects are Model Year, Fuel Type, Kms, Condition, No. of Owners.
> Example for Single: Package after graduation can be Predicted upon the CGPA aquired.

    - Use of statistical techniques to give computer system to learn with data w/o explicit programs is called Machine Learning
    - Act of programming computer so that they can learn from data.
→ Types Of ML:-
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Semi-Supervised Learning
